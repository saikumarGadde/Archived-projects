68,68,68,Bank account or service,"Account opening, closing, or management","This is a concern with companies in general. The retention of personal information i.e. email, phone number, address, and social security number even after business with a company is no longer prevalent. Specifically, Capitol One 360 has said information and according to their policy they can not delete the it. In light of recent hacks to many consumer 's financial information I am concerned about having that on file from a company which I no longer conduct any business. They may notify me after the fact of any breach, however, what is a person to do if their information especially Social Security number is compromised. It would be proactive to not have that information available in the first place, especially when all accounts are closed. Lastly why do they need to keep this information? With several companies, XXXX and XXXX in particular, data mining people 's information only to be sold to advertisers and whomever else for profit, I can only speculate as to what these financial institutions are doing with this information. I write asking for a proposal for legislative change that gives the consumer power to redact and delete their details from companies when they choose to no longer conduct any business with them. In the mean time are there any other means a consumer can use to achieve this? It appears we 're all at the mercy of the company 's policy.

I went to the bank XXXX mins after the call and done what was requested. Prior before leaving I was told that my account will be back up and running and to not worry about anything. I have repeatedly call for XXXX weeks asking what has happened to my account for them to close it. I have talked to the Capital One Fraud Supervisor who could not tell me why they close my account. They have sent me no notice of intent to close, fraud or anything of that nature. Nobody can give me an answer of why my account is restricted. It is fishy to me that my account went closed after I made a cash deposit in the bank. I am applying for mortgage next month and due to my account being restricted or closed, I can not pay down my balance to lower my utilization rate. The Fraud Supervisor told me I could still make payments but when I went to pay down on it the branch tellers told me I could n't because the account was closed due to Fraud. I am worried about my credit score and can not get any answers from no Supervisors of Capital One. All they keep saying is my account is under investigation for Fraud but they have found no Fraud on my end. So I keep asking why do my credit score has to suffer because of something they are messing up on. They can not give me a clear answer.

Imagine the people who wait and try to pay the bill at the last minute. The company has limited hours to help with these problems. Their web sit does not allow you to reset a pin ( if the web site did work which it does not ). When you contact their service representative, he is insulting and unhelpful. He implies it is your fault for not being able to use their system properly. Capital One sends information about how easy it is to pay your bill, but their system is not usable. There is no way to pay your bill. I have just now received a letter from them that we can pay be online, by phone, and by mail. I was told by the customer service rep that I could not pay by phone until the system was set up. It looks like I am suppose to pay by mail as my only option. I do not have any confidence that they will correctly process my mail payment.

It is quite possible that Capital One has a standard that I did not reach with regard to credit worthiness. Unfortunately, I can not help but wonder who does qualify for the lower rate they advertise. With excellent credit, I would like to know why I did not qualify for the lower rate. If Capital One has a very narrow qualifying criteria for the lower rate, they should disclose what score is necessary to obtain the low rate or not advertise the lower rate. Generally, I believe Capital One should also be more transparent and forthcoming with what their standards are for interest rates for applicants.

I called Capital One directly to understand what happened. I spoke with a respresentative for over 45 minutes while she tried to figure out what happened. She placed me on hold several times so she could speak to her manager to get a better understanding. With each explanation I could state, based on what she told me, I still should not have to pay interest. At first she stated my payment went to the lowest interest rate balance first, which I stated is very unfair and deceptive as payments should be made to the highest interest rate balance first. I eventually asked to speak with her manager after she wanted to speak with him for either a third or fourth time. The supervisor came on ( expected a manager ) and he stated the grace period was waived once I requested the courtesy check and I would have to make a payment of all charges, even after the statement date, to forego interest charges. I would like to point out with this explanation, I would have to access my account online and then overpay that amount to guess what my upcoming charges may be so I do n't have to pay interest on any charges. I find the fact the initial representative could not explain to me what happend on my bill to support my claim of unfair and deceptive marketing and practices by Capital One. The supervisor did tell me I was told these terms when I requested my courtesy check and I informed him I had to ask the representative to slow down and repeat herself on several occassions and then I recapped the terms to make sure I fully understood what I was getting into. I did not recall the waiving of a grace period for charges. The supervisor stated he would review the call and get back to me no sooner than this Wednesday since he would be off the next few days.

2701,2701,2701,Credit card,Other,"XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXCapital One XXXXFor more than XXXX years I have tried to verify the above mentioned accounts via certified letters and phone correspondence. 

According to my records, each account has been reported separately, and simultaneously, to the credit bureaus under both creditor names : Capital One and XXXX XXXX. 


My efforts to verify these accounts are complicated by the following facts : Capital One and XXXX appear to report these alleged debts using different account numbers. 
Alleged amounts owed on these accounts, have been in close proximation, but never exact. 
XXXX does not respond to my requests. It appears Capital One responds to inquiries for both companies. 
Capital One uses the last XXXX digits of the alleged account number in correspondence, yet credit reports reflect what appear to be beginning numbers. 
Despite the fact that I sent a copy of my SS card and driver 's license with my inquires to Capital One, their company responded with asking me to verify my own information. 
Despite the fact I stated I had no knowledge or records of the accounts in my request for verification letters, and that I suspected fraud, Capital One responded asking me to provide them with the account numbers. 
XXXX ( Case # XXXX ), ( XXXX - Case # XXXX ) and XXXX ( File # XXXX ) claim to have verified these accounts - but have never provided me with proof. 
I have never been sent collection letters from XXXX or Capital One. 

I highly suspect the above mentioned accounts, are accounts Capital One previously removed from my credit reports, and are now reporting the same again. 

It does appear the XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts did not belong to me. I filed a Chapter XXXX 100 % creditor payout in XXXX of 2012. Through this process, a hearing was held on multiple creditor claims. This hearing assisted with confirming numerous accounts were fraudulent or unverifiable. Without ordering an expensive transcript of the hearing, I can not share if these accounts were fraudulent or unverifiable. 

It should be noted, Capital One nor XXXX attempted to place a claim during the bankruptcy process. Please find attached a claim summary prepared by the Chapter XXXX trustee. 

Only XXXX response letter, from Capital One, claims XXXX XXXX XXXX was sold to another company, XXXX XXXX XXXX . 

Yet it was XXXX XXXX who placed, and was denied a claim, during the bankruptcy process for this account. 

Regardless, all XXXX accounts remain on my credit report, and I remain confident they do not belong to me. 

Please seek proper documentation on each account under FCRA and FDCP rules for collection and reporting. 

Please seek immediate removal of each account if the creditors can not provide said verification.

On the same day, I went online to the XXXX County Clerk 's website, my home is located in XXXX County, and was able to pull down, for expediency, an unofficial copy of the Satisfaction of Mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX XXXX '' ). I faxed the document to XXXX. Attached is an official copy of the Satisfaction of Mortgage received XXXX XXXX. XXXX led me to believe that if the document evidenced the transfer, in his exact words "" ... will work '' To my deterimnant, I relied on his words and informed my architect to continue working on the plans which resulted in an additional cost to me of {$750.00}. I discovered, on XX/XX/XXXX, while checking Capital 's website and no replies from XXXX or his manager that my loan was denied. There was no reason provided on the site. There was a phone number XXXX provided to call with any questions which I did. I spoke with a rep, # XXXX, he said that the loan had to be completed within a certain amount of days or it will be closed and that a Satisfaction of Mortgage was required. I asked to speak with XXXX 's manager, XXXX, and was told she was in a meeting and would get back to me on the same day. Needless to say, she has never contacted me. To add insult to injury, when I arrived home, I received i the mail from my homeowner 's insurance company that Captial had already designated themselves as the XXXX mortgagee on my policy. I believe that my loan was improperly handled and incorrectly denied. Neither XXXX or his manager appear to be of any assistance in correcting this error. Instead, they choose to ignore a client.

4023,4023,4023,Credit card,Other,"This matter deals with Capital One 's practices concerning automatic payment enrollment for their credit cards, which I believe violates the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and its accompanying regulation B, general fair lending principles, the Consumer Financial Protection Act 's prohibition on unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, FTC Section 5, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud Protection Act. 

As you can see from the class action I am prepared to file, attached to this letter, Capital One has told me a number of times that it restricts its enrollment in automatic payments to online only. Because of this restrictive practice, Cardholders who do not have internet access, or who can not or do not want to register for online activity, are deprived of the ability to make automatic payments. Cardholders who do not sign up for automatic payments are more likely to forget to make a payment, thereby incurring late fees and additional interest charges. Capital One in fact charges late fees when Cardholders do not make timely payments, and reports those late fees as part of the Cardholder 's balance to the major credit reporting agencies. I myself have incurred late fees and additional interest charges several times due to the fact that Capital One will not allow me to enroll in automatic payments via telephone. 

Capital One reports Cardholder balances to the XXXX major credit reporting agencies, inclusive of the late fees and additional interest charges incurred because they are unable to enroll in automatic payments. Cardholders who do not have internet access, or have limited access, or who prefer not to engage in online activity are disadvantaged by Capital One 's practice of limiting enrollment in automatic payments to online only, or alternatively, are disadvantaged by Capital One 's practice of misleading Cardholders into thinking that they can not enroll in automatic payments via telephone. 

As you know, Cardholders who do not have internet access, or have limited access, or who prefer not to engage in online activity are more likely to be elderly, lower income, minorities or active military. I believe Capital One 's practice of restricting automatic payments to online access only has a discriminatory effect on members of protected classes under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

To the extent Capital One does allow telephone enrollment in automatic payments, its practice of telling Cardholders that enrollment is limited to internet only is false, misleading, and designed to force Cardholders to incur late fees and additional interest charges, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act and Section 5.

4116,4116,4116,Bank account or service,"Account opening, closing, or management","Capital One has violated these laws, as explained below : Consumer Financial Protection Act, FTC Section 5, Truth in Savings Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Maryland Consumer Fraud Protection Act. 

Capital One forced open our safe deposit box and liquidated its contents without notice to us. Through mishandling, they lost the contents. They insisted that they forced the box open because we did not pay the rental fees. In fact, our checking account was set up such that the rental fees were automatically debited from the account each year. At some point, due to a security concern, we changed our checking account number. Capital One failed to link the new account number to the safe deposit box, which is what led to the perceived nonpayment. At no time did Capital One give us notice that there was an issue with the fees, nor did they give us notice when they forced the box open and liquidated the contents. 
Our box contained irreplaceable jewelry that my parents purchased for us as wedding gifts from XXXX. As is common in XXXX families, these pieces of jewelry have incredible tangible, not to mention, sentimental value. The box also contained some legal documents concerning my uncle 's estate, which are irreplaceable and difficult to re-execute, considering he lives in another country. 

Capital One claims to have sent the property to the Maryland Division of Unclaimed Property, despite that documentation the bank itself provided to me showed that nothing but "" miscellaneous documents '' were sent, despite also giving us an inventory showing that the box contained several pieces of jewelry. The Division has conducted exhaustive searches and has confirmed that it never received, nor does it have, any of our property from Capital One. Rather than address the merits of our claim, Capital One has been "" searching '' for our property for nearly a year, with no success. We have impressed upon them that the injury was inflicted when they failed to link the new account number to the box and failed to give us notice, but they continue to attempt to shift the blame to the XXXX. 

Capital One has further indicated that they do not believe we ever signed up for automatic debit form our account to pay the box rental fees. However, they in fact debited our account for the fees for approximately XXXX years. If they do not believe we had signed up for automatic debit, then debiting our account without our consent constitutes a violation of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693a et seq., as well as the NACHA rules. 

We sued Capital One in federal court on an individual basis. Again, rather than address the merits, they chose to fight us on jurisdictional grounds. This is what prompted us to file a class action in Maryland, to fight for our rights and those of others similarly situated. Ultimately, the bank will have to address the merits of our claims and those of others. It puzzles us that the bank wo n't simply admit that they did something wrong, and chooses instead to force consumers to jump through hoops like this, when it is their own wrongdoing that is in question.

I have asked for a credit limit increase on my accounts and they will not grant me my requests month after month and has been close to XXXX years or longer on some of my accounts. They send me a reply back explaining why and the reasons are not justified. I will enclose proper documentation as well with this complaint. I have never been late on my accounts and I have never been over the credit line or missed any payments. I have used my accounts a lot and I pay them on time as well sometimes even several weeks ahead of payment due date and frequently more than once in the same billing period and I have made well above the minimum payments that their last denial of credit line increase saids I was n't making the more than the minimum and yet I can show that as well is incorrect. I feel like I am being discriminated with Capital One on not getting the same services that other good account holders have access to. I show excellent responsibilities on my accounts that should warrant no denial for credit line increases and additional spending power that I should be entitled to as the next person. I have XXXX account with them and XXXX of the XXXX are paid in FULL and have XXXX balances since XXXX 2014 and they still decline credit limit increases on these accounts as well. They have no real excuses but send me bogus if not random computer generated responses that show no merits to what they declined me for and if not at least being discriminated then perhaps a huge error in their approval for such request should be noticed and investigated into. I have all supporting documentation to show my concerns here and I have even contacted Capital One about this issue several times and they seem to over look and or not seem concerned about my complaints and questions. The last complaint was about a week ago and they said their RESOLUTIONS DEPARTMENT would call me and of course this proved to be false and I never heard anything back from Capital One as they said I would in XXXX business days of initial complaint filed. Capital One should not be allowed to treat me differently for whatever their criteria is if they are not following the same business practices with everyone else that is holding the same standards of account responsibilities and should not be allowed to pick and choose who is entitled to privy rewards and who is n't when regardless that both parties take good accountabilities on their credit card accounts. My status is excellent with the way I handle my accounts and they do not have any real reasons NOT to grant my requests when I ask for them. They send me their reasons to why I was not approved by these reasons can be justified and proven that it is n't so. This is not right and should not be tolerated from a business that can not be diligently fair and reasonable with every account holder with fairness and unbiased and non discriminatory when making decisions and should be viable and legitimate reasons for declined of such asked requests when requested by an account holder such as myself.

This is not about the {$3.00} but the principle of what they aretelling their new accountholders both personally and on their web pagesand their response to my concerns which involve hiding behind '' procedures '' rather than just acknowledging the issue and refundingmy fee. I escalated the matter to a manager who also stonewalled untilthey could conduct "" research '' into the matter.

5236,5236,5236,Credit card,Rewards,"I have a CapitalOne "" World '' Mastercard, which has a cashback bonus program. I always pay the balance in full each month by using CapitalOne 's website to schedule a withdrawal from my checking account, to occur on the due date. To make my most recent payment, I redeemed most of my accumulated cashback bonus for an account credit, and ( as I normally do ) used CapitalOne 's website to schedule a withdrawal from my checking account, setting the amount to the difference between the balance due and the cashback credit amount. After the due date, I got an email from CapitalOne saying they were charging me roughly {$10.00} in interest. I called them to find out why, and the representative told me that CapitalOne does not count credits ( including both cashback bonus amounts and refunds from merchants ) as "" payments '', and so they do n't reduce the amount you owe for a prior statement period. Instead, CapitalOne nets such "" credits '' against the purchases you make during the statement period in which they occur, reducing the amount that you will owe on the *next* statement. This delay in accounting for credits seems to me to be unfair, illogical, and not in keeping with how such transactions are treated by other providers in the industry. Certainly, it is not how cashback bonus redemptions or refunds are treated in my XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card accounts. I always pay the balance on those cards in full each month, and whenever I have a cashback bonus redemption or other credit to my account, I reduce my payment accordingly. I have been doing this for over a decade, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX treat those "" credits '' just like any other payment. 
Further problematic, to my mind, is that CapitalOne 's treatment of credits is conditional on subsequent transactions. This seems even more unjustifiable. Specifically, if, after a statement period ends, your subsequent "" credit '' transactions exceed subsequent purchases, then ( and only then ) the amount you need to pay to avoid finance charges is reduced by the difference. So for example, let 's say your statement for XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX shows a balance due of {$1000.00}, with payment due on XXXX XXXX. Then, on XXXX XXXX, you get a refund of {$300.00} ( say, because you returned an item you purchased in XX/XX/XXXX ). Under CapitalOne 's policy, that {$300.00} does not *necessarily* reduce the amount you need to pay by XXXX XXXX to avoid finance charges. If you charge nothing during XX/XX/XXXX, then you need only pay {$700.00}. But if you charge {$300.00} or more, you have to send CapitalOne {$1000.00} by XXXX XXXX. I can see no legitimate justification for this inconsistent treatment of the credit transaction. Either CapitalOne got that {$300.00} before the due date, or it did not. Its inconsistent treatment of the credit seems like an attempt to hide an improper policy from scrutiny by tempering its most egregious effects. 
A further ridiculous consequence of this policy : a direct redemption of a cashback bonus for statement credit is not a "" payment '', but if the cashback bonus is credited to my bank account, and I then send the money right back to CapitalOne, it is. 
CapitalOne 's odd practice is a trap for the unwary. At the very least, it should disclose the practice clearly, unambiguously, and prominently, in a location and context that ensures consumers will understand and be able to account for it.

Once completed he then looked in the system and stated that only XXXX XXXX dollars would be available until the check was cleared for funds which could take up to 3 days having that it was Friday.

The inquiry showed up on both my and my fiancee 's XXXX reports. My fiancee has, to this day, received no notification she had even applied for this account. We both disputed the inquiry with XXXX. XXXX has found Capital One 360 's inquiry valid. My complaint is that I no longer feel safe using Capital One 360 and am weary of any other internet banking service. Neither me, nor my fiancee submitted an application for this checking account. We began the application to find out whether the account could be opened without the overdraft line of credit as we had no interest in such a feature. The webpage logged us out for inactivity on the final page of the application while we read the fine print pop up for this account and compared it to other checking accounts. We never clicked submit on this application. Somehow Capital One 360 's website pushed the application through while logging us out for inactivity. This error, juxtaposed with Capital One 360 's denial of the possibility of an error, makes their online application process deceptive and dishonest.

6420,6420,6420,Credit card,Transaction issue,"My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a Capital One XXXX holder. This complaint relates to the dispute resolution process at Cap One, which they claim is regulated by XXXX, yet neither entity is able to provide me a copy of the said offending regulation. 
About a week ago, I initiated a claim to dispute a transaction that was charged in error by the merchant XXXX XXXX. Per usual Cap One issued an immediate credit for the transaction and I guess notified the merchant as dictated by their policies. In a span of a week, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received an email from Cap One notifying me of an important document available online for me to review. The said document was a correspondence from Cap One informing me that the merchant had apparently responded by sending them some sort of paperwork which I have n't even seen yet, leave alone be able to send in my response. Cap one further noted that they would be reversing the earlier credit they had posted to my account that would be reflected on my statement of XXXX XXXX. I figured that I 'd have at least till then to rebut the merchant 's claim as soon as the hard copy of whatever they had submitted reached me. Guess what? I was dreaming! The charge had appeared online the very next day which is today, XXXX XXXX. 
Obviously I called to challenge Cap One 's decision to charge back my account. Now, mind you, I have dealt with disputes and claims process with my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, before and even they, as attached as they can get to their research outcome into consumer disputes, are not quite as hard-nosed in handling claims as much as Cap One has been in my experience. In the twenty minutes I was on the phone with them, they told me that they were bound by a regulation from XXXX that mandated that they re-charge my account the instant the merchant named in the claim responds back. They seemed to be indicating that even though I had n't received any copies of the paperwork returned by the merchant yet, even though they were still in the process of reviewing my claim, and even though I had until XXXX XXXX to send in my response once I received those documents, they were obligated to reverse the credit issued barely a week ago and charge me account again. I demanded for a copy of the said regulation they purportedly were bound by in their relationship with XXXX. They could provide me none!! Instead, they gave me a toll-free number for XXXX and instructed to take up the issue with them. Hmpht! Seeing as I am on long-term XXXX, I was n't quite relishing having another testy exchange with another difficult corporate monster. And my reservation proved to be accurate. 
Next, I called XXXX at the number Cap One had provided me, XXXX. I had the misfortune of getting a representative by the name of "" XXXX XXXX ( I particularly made sure to get this identification before I hung up with her ). In the call which lasted fifteen minutes, she had my head spinning by giving me the worst run-around.

Her tone, and a barely audible sound of laughter in the background is what gave me that feeling. All she kept reiterating was that Cap One could not provide me with a copy of such information because that was part of an agreement between them and XXXX, nor would she send me a copy. Her tone did register an element of surprise when I informed her that Cap One 's review was ongoing, and I had n't even had a chance to respond to the merchant 's claims. As my frustration and exasperation began mounting, I then asked her which particular government entity regulated them.

I made a purchase at the store XXXX XXXX and had no issues with the card, 2 days after the purchase and 2 days before this complain, I get a call from Kohl stating That I owed {$89.00}. I was informed that I owned {$32.00} balance and {$48.00} in fees. At that time, the representative willing to discount all the extra charges and I was only to pay {$32.00}. I tried to discuss with the Kohl 's representive at the time but I had to do my due diligence and go through my paperwork. I discovered that indeed I did owe {$32.00}. When I called back, that 's when they refused to discount the total fees and told me if I did n't pay My account would be reported to the credit bureau. They refuse to give me a supervisor or a name or number to someone else to talk to. I would like you assistance in resolving this matter

With this particular card, I truly believe that I was merely an authorized user and thus, not liable on the debt. Despite repeated phone calls disputing this debt ( going back to XXXX though they first have it documented in XXXX XXXX, I am not only continually harassed by their collection team but they kick me around to different units every time I call to resolve this issue ( from collections to the decedent group to customer service ) every time I call requiring up to 3 hours of my time. I have requested evidence that I am on the contract as a joint party XXXX given situation described above of other cards and the fact that it is easy for their system - due to human error/changing or migrating systems - to incorrectly categorize me, as this has happened with other cards XXXX. I was told they could not find the application and that I needed to write a letter to a unit Utah requesting the contract and I would receive the contract, evidence of, or a letter stating what happens if they do not have it. I was to receive this within 7 - 10 days or my written request. I tracked the letter I sent and it was delivered on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I still have not heard back. I still can not get any answers. I am still receiving harassing calls despite numerous requests to stop and my ongoing dispute of the the veracity of the debt, requiring me to stop answering my home phone - especially when company is over. They are still reporting delinquencies to credit bureaus even though I asked if they could stop or notate a dispute until resolved, which has caused me great humiliation as I could n't even qualify for a {$1000.00} limit at a furniture store to replace the couch my husband died on let alone refinance my mortgage to take advantage of lower rates ( causing me long term financial harm ). I do not mind paying if I am on the debt - as I have done so with other cards. However, I believe that this was only in my husband 's name. Instead, I consistently get treated poorly, get harassed by collectors - despite disputing the debt and asking them to stop calling - and get punted around seemingly eternally. Making all of this worse, is the extremely inconsistent information and "" answers '' I get every time. I am asking for simple proof - my personal experience and the events in mortgage servicing, for example, are demonstrative that I should not need to rely on their word or their system for proof as if it is infallible. Simply provide me with evidence and let us move onward. Simple request. Instead, the company continues to cause me emotional pain, stress, embarrassment, and direct financial harm. I am exhausted and drained. I need closure not more runarounds and false hope. I was supposed to have "" the answer '' within 7-10 days of XXXX XXXX, 2015. This has been going on now almost 6 months and has cost me emotionally and an undeterminable amount of money on my ability to refinance my mortgage. I understand economics and promises to pay and will honor it if I am, in fact, liable. However, I truly and reasonably believe this was XXXX of my late husband 's personal cards.

XXXX was able to get court documents directly from the court. After examining the documents, it can be noted that the proof of debt did not include list of transactions that was not paid.

I wanted to send a wire and check my balances. I was asked if I needed to update my information, which I did ( address and tel numbers ) on XXXX of my accounts. I was told that "" I have to sign the change forms '', which I did. Afterward, I asked to get a copy of all the documents that I signed, and I was told that I could not have the copies. It was explained by more than XXXX employee, including the manger of the branch, that the policy forbids that they release those "" internal '' forms to me. I explained that as soon as my signature was required, and I signed the form, that whether they considered them "" internal '' or not, I was entitled to copies of my own documents that contained my signature. 3+hours later, I was told that the district manager would contact me, which she did. In the meantime, and since that time I still do not have copies of the forms that I signed, even though I requested them at each step. 
1. I have asked or a copy of the policy or policies that explain ( s ) the bank 's position on refusing to provide copies of forms signed by a customer of Capital One to said customer after he signs them. 
2. Though I was repeatedly told at the branch that this is "" the policy '' I have been given no straight, unequivocal answer as to whether such a policy exists ; nor have I been told that the bank will provide me with that or any other explanation as to why their address forms or any other documents which contain my signature may not be provided to me. 
3. I have been told that, according to the "" office of the President '' of Capital One bank, and "" XXXX '' who works in that department, that "" there are no disclosures '' that delineate the policy regarding the bank 's refusal to provide copies to the client of forms he just signed, but that any details about such policies as well as whether they exist is an "" internal '' issue. 
4. The answer in # XXXX is an example of the doublespeak and equivocation that I am describing : "" no disclosures '' in my understanding means no approved public material that the bank will release to explain their policy. That does NOT answer the question as to whether the bank is taking the position that they flatly refuse to make copies of a client 's signature and give it to him as part of ANY FORM that he signed. 
5. Another example is when I was told that "" if I want help from '' the office of the president that I 'm going to have to be specific about the "" documents that I am requesting. '' I told them that "" any form that has my signature on it '' are the forms that I am requesting in my particular case, but also:6.

11219,11219,11219,Mortgage,Settlement process and costs,"I am attempting to close a refinancing on a property pursuant to a divorce buy-out. My ex-husband is still on title to the property, but will not be on the refinancing mortgage, this is not his primary dwelling ( not since 2005 ), and he will be removed from the deed when proceeds are received from the refinancing. 
Capital One is requiring closing disclosures to be sent to ex-husband under 12 CFR 1026.17 ( d ) on the belief that XXXX XXXX has a right to rescind under 12 CFR 1026.23. I feel this disclosure is my confidential information that should not be shared. 
Capital One is prepared to tell ex-husband that he has a right to rescind my refinancing solely on the basis that he is on title to the financed property, since he is not a party to the mortgage refinancing, and the security interest is not being taken in his principal residence/home. 
Does Capital One have a right to disclose the information? I do not believe so because no security interest is being taken in his principal dwelling when reading the definition of "" consumer '' below, i.e., he has no right to rescind. The rules further state that a person can only have XXXX principal dwelling, and ex-husband 's is not the property to be financed. 

2 ( a ) ( 11 ) Consumer1. Scope. Guarantors, endorsers, and sureties are not generally consumers for purposes of the regulation, but they may be entitled to rescind under certain circumstances and they may have certain rights if they are obligated on credit card plans. 
2. Rescission rules. For purposes of rescission under 1026.15 and 1026.23, a consumer includes any natural person whose ownership interest in his or her principal dwelling is subject to the risk of loss. Thus, if a security interest is taken in A 's ownership interest in a house and that house is A 's principal dwelling, A is a consumer for purposes of rescission, even if A is not liable, either primarily or secondarily, on the underlying consumer credit transaction. An ownership interest does not include, for example, leaseholds or inchoate rights, such as dower. 
I look forward to a resolution with Capital One to proceed.

11312,11312,11312,Credit card,Advertising and marketing,"When I was shopping at Kohl 's on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the salesclerk convinced me to apply for a Kohl 's charge card by promising that I would get 30 % off of my purchase. However, instead of the application being accepted, a receipt printed that said : "" We are unable to complete processing of your application at this time. '' The clerk said that this meant that my application was declined. He could no longer provide me with the 30 % off. Additionally, he took back the written terms and conditions for the credit card. I questioned him if the application was in fact denied, since that was not what the receipt said. He said that the application was denied and that 's what that message meant. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called the Kohl 's Charge Account customer service number at XXXX. I spoke with XXXX, who then transferred me to XXXX. I wanted to confirm that the application was in fact denied and was not being processed. XXXX stated that my application was denied and I would be receiving a letter within 30 days explaining why it was denied. 
Since I did not receive the promised discount and was not able to keep a copy of the terms and conditions - and therefore was not able to read the terms and conditions - I wanted to make sure that the card was not processed. I fully understood that there would be a credit pull on my credit report ; however, if the application was still being processed and was not declined, I did not want a trade line reported or something showing that I closed the account, since this will negatively affect my credit. 
Imagine my surprise when, instead of receiving a letter stating why my application was denied, I received a credit card in the mail. So, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I wrote to Kohl 's Credit Customer Service. I asked for a refund of the amount I should have saved if I had received the promised 30 % discount. I also asked for Kohl 's to mail me a copy of the credit card 's terms and conditions and train its employees to provide accurate information. 
I received a letter from Kohl 's dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. Enclosed was a copy of the Cardmember Agreement. However, Kohl 's declined to provide me with the promised discount because I did not make any purchases on a Kohl 's Credit Card - which I could n't do, because at the time of purchase, the application was still being process. However, Kohl 's offered a courtesy credit on a future purchase. This offer was not clear, so on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I sent an email to the address provided by Kohl 's to clarify the courtesy offer. 
Kohl 's responded that it could n't assist me by email so I called the customer service number on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I spoke with XXXX. She informed me that Kohl 's would provide me with a 30 % discount if I made a purchase with my Kohl 's card and then submitted a claim for a credit to my account. But, I could not combine the 30 % discount with any other discounts being offered at the store. So, for example, if the store was offering a 20 % discount, I would need to skip the 20 % discount and not use any coupons in order to receive the 30 % discount from the Kohl 's card. Or, I could go on one of the days when the store was not offering any discounts - XXXX checked and there were only XXXX such days in the entire month. 
Since I was not being offered the promised benefit that induced me to sign up for the card, I asked Kohl 's to cancel the card. Since Kohl 's refused to honor its promotion and I never activated or used the credit card, I asked Kohl 's to request that the consumer reporting agencies XXXX CRAs ) suppress the trade line. XXXX said that she could n't do that but that I could send a formal request in writing.

11520,11520,11520,Credit card,Billing disputes,"This complaint could be much longer and include many more details, but I will keep it as brief and concise as possible. 
I ordered a watch from a merchant, which arrived with several defects. XXXX of the defects was bent hands, and I took it upon myself to straighten them myself. 
I carefully checked the merchant 's terms and conditions before I did this, and there was nothing which indicated doing this would invalidate the warranty. When I notified the merchant about the problem and told him that I had fixed it myself, he immediately acccused me of lying and blocked my from accessing his website by banning my IP address. I asked to return the watch for a refund, as the merchant obviously was not going to honor the stated 2 year warranty. My request was denied on the grounds that merely opening the watch case voided the warranty - even though this was not forbidden in the merchant warranty policies. 
I disputed the charge on my credit card through Capital One, who sided with the merchant. It turned out that in the merchant 's response, he fraudulently altered the terms and conditions on his website in response to my dispute, and then submitted those in his rebuttal. In other words, the warranty policy that the merchant relied on in the dispute was not the same policy that was in effect when I made the purchase. It was XXXX that the merchant invented specifically to deny my claim. 
I provided proof of this fraud to Capital One in the form of screenshots of the merchant website, but they would not change their ruling. They only said that they had to base their decision on the merchant 's policy, even though I provided proof that the policy was changed after my dispute was filed. The specific changes can be seen in this screenshot : XXXX 
Afterwards, I contacted the merchant again, asking him how he justified changing the terms whenever he felt like it, without even notifying customers. His response was that it was always the "" intent '' of the policy, he just made it "" more clear ''. Unfortunately, as a customer who relies on the text of the policy as stated ( not the merchant 's intentions at any given time ), this leaves me at a disadvantage. And I do not believe that Capital One and Visa properly took this into consideration during my dispute process.

Secondly, and to justify the denial, Capital One Bank stated that my credit utilization rate was too high.

As a matter of practice, credit card issuers make their money off credit account holders such as myself ; That is those who routinely carry a balance.

The service rep who is employed by Capital One and identified himself as a Capital One Employee states on the recording that there was a system error when I made the payment thus not crediting it to my account nor removing it from my bank account. It is and has been Capital One 's position that there contract with the Credit bureaus does n't allow them to change this supposed late pay that was made timely and was not credited nor deducted according to their own employee as a result of a SYSTEM ERROR ON CAPITAL ONE 'S END. I do n't want to retain a lawyer but will and I am sure after they hear the recording which I have offered to let any capital one employee hear and they have refused. Capital One 's position is that we ca n't record calls.

I received no phone call, email, or other contact. My contact information is and was correct and up to date. Similarly, my account had automatic payments setup to avoid such a situation, and no automatic payment was submitted or applied. I only learned of the balance from a credit monitoring service after Capital One reported negative information on my credit report. 

I take my credit, reported information, and scores very seriously. I am vigilant about paying my bills and always paying on time. I have XXXX negative items on my credit reports, that is, until XXXX XXXX, when Capital One incorrectly reported the above as a missed payment, to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

Even after being alerted to their error, Capital One refuses to do anything to correct the mistake. In fact they act intentionally to reaffirm the information they report, without reviewing that it is correct. 

Filing a dispute with the CRAs is useless. Capital One 's nvestigations into disputes are automated, include no human review, and rely solely on the self-reinforcing data they have previously provided. No actual verification takes place. Blanket, automated confirmations sent in response to disputes. Investigations and review of their responsibilities to furnish accurate and complete information are instant, and even take place on weekends and holidays during which Capital One business offices are closed. 

Capital One does not take seriously or respond to requests for review, completely disregarding their responsibilities and requirements as a furnisher of data to consumer reporting agencies. They have XXXX regard for the devastating financial and personal harms they have caused by incorrectly reporting negative information. 

I want to close my accounts and sever any and all relationships I have with Capital One, but am afraid that if I am to close my account they will never fix this issue. It is for this reason I turn to submitting a dispute, in the hope that the error is corrected on my credit report, and that Capital One does not continue doing this to others.

13760,13760,13760,Credit card,Other,"I am writing because I believe I am being scammed by my former credit card provider, Capital One. I recently called their customer service to ask for help with an unauthorized charge to my credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, after my car broke down, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX for a tow. The tow-truck driver attempted to use my credit card twice as payment for the tow. He told me the charges were declined or failed to go through. As a result, I was forced to pay {$50.00} cash for the tow. Three days later I had XXXX {$50.00} charges on my credit card, which I assumed were from those two attempts. I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that I had not authorized the charges, and that I had "" no receipt '' or any other document of such transactions. I expected Capital One, to call either the tow company or its credit provider to find out what the problem was. They clearly did not make any form of contact with either since I spoke to the owner of the tow company. When I called the tow company on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that their records did not show any charges. I was assured that even if my credit card was charged accidentally, the credit will return. This I believe is where a possible scam within Capital One is taking place. I suspect that when a customer calls about unauthorized credit card charges, which Capital One would otherwise have returned had the customer not tipped them off by asking to dispute the claim, rather than crediting the customer 's account, Capital One instead initiates some bogus claim dispute. Capital One asks for documents that it clearly knows do not exist, such as credit receipts for fraudulent charge, which the customer "" has explained do not exist, '' in order to prolong the process or get a customer to default on a claim. Through this process, I suspect that Capital One scams its customers out of money, which it would otherwise have returned to the customers ' credit cards had the customers not asked Capital One for help. Because I refused to accept this, I have been led for 3 months to believe that my claims would be taken care of. I believe Capital One has done nothing the whole time since I have been the XXXX contacting them to get any serious update. For instance, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, which stated that XXXX of my {$50.00} claims was closed. The letter said that the other {$50.00} claim would be rebilled to the merchant, and if the merchant recharges my card, then it would be closed as well. When I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX for updates, I got all kinds of obvious excuses. I was told that based on the document I sent, none of my claims were strong enough. So, I should dispute the claims with the merchant. They did not mention anything about the rebill to the merchant, which was strange since my credit card was recharged only {$50.00} suggesting that the other {$50.00} supposedly rebilled was likely just another last minute excuse, considering all they had to do was add or subtract numbers. Furthermore, about a month ago, Capital One was uncooperative when the tow company owner asked me for documents to show his credit company to look into my dispute. Capital One created an impression that if I sent them a copy of my original "" cash receipt, '' they would fight the dispute. Yet, during the XX/XX/XXXX phone call, I was told that based on the receipt I sent, they did not feel I had a strong case worth fighting for. I have had smaller credit charges to my account in the past, which they have not even requested a single document, and which were less credible than this one. I feel that they may be bias against me perhaps because I recently opened a {$4000.00} credit line with XXXX XXXX. I was also recently forced to close my Capital One bank account because they started charging me monthly fees, around XX/XX/XXXX, even though when I opened the account I was guaranteed no monthly charges.

Naturally, the higher payment could not be met since it was even higher than the defaulted rate I was requesting a reprieve from. I had no choice but to reject the offer. I also continued making the full payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. However, in XX/XX/XXXX Capital one sent me a notice for foreclosure.

14611,14611,14611,Consumer Loan,Managing the loan or lease,"Dear Sir or Madam : We are writing to dispute the following information in my file. I have highlighted the item I dispute on the attached copy of the report I received. 
This item Capital One Auto payment for XXXX XXXX is inaccurate on all the credit reporting agencies for XXXX and XXXX XXXX and specifically on XXXX it displays 60 days late or XXXX or more payments. The information is inaccurate because XXXX attempted to pay this amount utilizing the creditors web pay system, but it was unavailable. XXXX contacted the creditor via telephone on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and explained she was trying to access her account for review and payment to pay the amount of {$460.00} which would have been within the terms of agreement to satisfy the amount due and to prevent any 30 days late. The phone representative could not provide any assistance for XXXX to resolve the issues with the creditors web site unavailability. XXXX could barely understand the representative who spoke XXXX that was mostly non- legible. XXXX never understood the representative offer to review her account with her over the phone ; neither did she hear him ask to take the payment over the phone. The representative never advised XXXX that her payment was approaching a 30-day late status. In fact, XXXX became fairly impatient with the fact that she had someone who could barely speak XXXX and a website that was not available. This contact with customer service failed the XXXX in their attempt to pay the debt timely as they had done since inception of the loan nearly four years prior. XXXX eventually, after many hours and attempts was able to access the site without help from Customer Service. 
XXXX proceeded to make the payment via XXXX XXXX XXXX account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX on the web pay site for the Creditor. On the site and on the back of the bill ( see attached ) it clearly states that any payments made by check even if sent by someone else will be used for electronic transfer of funds may be withdrawn from your account the SAME DAY YOU MAKE OR WE RECEIVE YOUR PAYMENT. THERE IS NOTHING IN WRITING ON THIS BILL STATEMENT THAT INDICATES THE PAYMENT HAS TO POST TO YOUR ACCOUNT BEFORE IT IS CONSIDERED AS RECEIVED. In fact, XXXX and XXXX understanding in accordance with the terms of payment stipulated on the bill that the day a check is received is the day the funds should be considered as transferred and XXXX HAVE A RECEIPT OF PAYMENT BEING RECEIVED BY THE CREDITOR ON XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( See Enclosed ). The date XXXX wrote on the check has no bearing in accordance with the payment schedule terms found in writing on the site and on the back of the billing statement. Had the creditor acted as stated on the terms of the payment agreement and processed the check as an electronic transfer on the same day it was received ; then it would have been honored by the XXXX bank, just as it was on the day the Creditor decided to post the check ( See Enclosure ). The XXXX made their payment prior to XXXX XXXX, XXXX which was the deadline for the 30-day payment to be received prior to being considered as 30 days late. Further, this Creditor does not report to the credit reporting agencies until the XXXX day of the month. THIS WAS LONG AFTER THE XXXX PAYMENT HAD BEEN RECEIVED AND POSTED. The XXXX can not be responsible for when the Creditor post the payments. The payment was received in accordance with the terms and agreements to be made less than 30 days late. The date on the payment that was received XXXX XXXX, XXXX was XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but that was irrelevant.

The offer we received via e-mail is at the following URL XXXX When we received this e-mail, we had been looking at other savings accounts at other financial institutions. This offered the best bonus, and we decided to take advantage of it. To make the qualifying deposit, my wife transferred funds from her personal savings account at another financial institution to my checking account at the same financial institution. We then opened the joint account at Capital One, and we transferred my wife 's funds to that account, again, seeking to take advantage of the offer that Capital One had e-mailed to us. 

After some time, we realized that the {$300.00} cash bonus that was advertised in the offer had not been deposited into our joint account. At that point, I called Capital One to inquire about why that was the case. 

I spoke with XXXX customer service representatives and XXXX managers, all of whom told me that because I already had opened savings accounts at ING Direct that my wife and I could n't take advantage of the bonus offer. When I asked if my wife could then open an individual account and receive the bonus, they told me "" no, '' indicating that even though the offer is still valid that my wife had become ineligible because she was now a joint account holder with me. 

My wife never had a savings account at Capital One until we opened this joint account. We saw the ad that Capital One e-mailed to us, and we relied on that ad to our detriment. My wife transferred {$30000.00} of her own money to the account when there were other bonus offers at other institutions available, and we did so because Capital One 's ad did not in any way make clear to us that we would not be eligible for the bonus reward. 

Capital One 's customer service representative gave us the URL ( included above ) showing the e-mail ad that we received. Even looking at the ad again, after they told me that we were ineligible because I had a individual savings account that I had opened at a predecessor institution, I did not see any indication that we would be ineligible. The representative had to point out to me the fine print at the bottom of the page that I had no idea was there because nothing in the body of the ad suggests that there are additional eligibility restrictions. Specifically, at the top of the ad there is the bold "" Here 's how it works '' section, and there is nothing anywhere in the body of the webpage to suggest anything like "" See below for eligibility requirements '' or something to take effect - nothing directing me to the fine print that has the additional requirements. How could we possibly know, based on the body of that webpage, that there were those additional requirements and thus that we would be ineligible? There is no way we could have known that. 

This ad is unfair and deceptive on its face. Even reading the hidden "" What do I need to do to get my bonus '' in the fine print at the bottom of this page ( and, really, how is that supposed to be different from the "" Here 's how it works '' section? These should say the same thing! ), does n't tell me that we, as joint account holders, would n't be eligible for a bonus because I, individually, opened a savings account with ING years ago that Capital One assumed when it bought ING. 

After the phone call with Capital One 's CSRs, we each e-mailed Capital One requesting that they honor the offer. Capital One denied our request, simply indicating that we were ineligible for the reasons that they had already stated.

Other major credit card companies have this information on them and for good reason, Cap One does not. 
Lack of proper disclosure of this particular information directly triggers a charge of a high monthly late fee {$35.00} and an increase in rate to nearly 30 %. Due to this and the obvious and evident outrageous attempt of Capitol One to keep hidden select data ( when a Past due is occurring ), it is clear that this lack of disclosure and the corresponding customer service training has been intentionally engineered to originate revenue from unknowing credit card holders at the expense of the client with their credit rating ( 7 yr derog ) in balance The information in question that has been intentionally hidden on their statements, in their email correspondence and on their website is as follows : A reasonable person would not be able to ascertain, even with all statements in front of them and emails, a ) if they were delinquent currently, b ) how much was delinquent c ) the date the past due amount became delinquent. Additionally, the Customer Representatives at Capitol One are most certainly trained to "" wash over '' the subject as complaints come in, it was very obvious that the Supervisor XXXX ID # XXXX got these complaints all day long and I brought that up on the phone. She agreed. Phone calls are recorded at Capitol One. I had to ask simple questions as to whether or not, and when, delinquency notices were sent 4 or 5 times and got different answers each time and got the same run around with almost every reasonable question. At the end she finally agreed that they do not send past due notices and that the reason the pertinent and furthermore misleading information was not on statements was due to the fact that they feel they have provided proper notification of delinquency by simply changing the color to red on the top bar of the statement ( still without the words "" Account is past due, Amount Past due, dates ... on statement, emails, web ). Later, I spoke with her superior who was present on the call with her ( he talked over her ), XXXX, ID # XXXX. 
These are my requests : Please have Capitol One add on the fine print in their statement the CFPB complaint contact information. 
Please have Cap One put the words "" Amount Past Due '' and the respective past due balance on their statements ( when an account is past due ), in their email correspondence and on their website for account holders. 
Please have Cap One put the words "" Account is Past Due '' where/when applicable on their monthly statements, email correspondence and on website clearly and without ambiguity in top left quadrant of statement ( where the red bar is ). 
Please have Cap One reword their emails with email statement link to read "" Account Past Due '' and Payment Due Now and Amount to bring current '' in the text portion of the monthly statement emails when an account is past due. 
Please have Cap One send out delinquency notices when an account is at least 30 days past due via email and through the mail. Not Statement emails, separate notices that specifically read "" Account past due '' and the amount needed to bring account current.

I called into the company received their explanation and was told a card would be overnighted to me. I was skeptical but took them for their word. I then got a call back 15 minutes later saying that I would not, in fact be receiving my card the next day ... Monday but would receive it Tuesday. Tuesday came and still no card. When I called in again I was assured that it was shipped and would arrive be Wednesday. However the company could not provide me a tracking number which leads me to believe it was never shipped.

I fully explained that I had been hospitalized and continued to be under doctors care and expected to be out of work for an extended period of time due to being diagnosed with XXXX. I wanted to make sure I stayed in good standing with Capitol One. They suggested that I make a minimum payment and asked when I could do that. They were surprised when I said I could make those payments right then and they accepted payments on both accounts. They enrolled me in their special assistance program at that time. They discussed the terms of the program and the penalties and sanction if I failed to meet my obligation of the program. I promised at that time to bring my account current and that I would probably pay the account in full once my XXXX and insurance benefits became available to me. I contacted Capitol One multiple times since that conversation. I kept them informed about my anticipated payments and I obtained my payoff amounts from them. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX and paid {$1600.00} on XXXX account and {$590.00} on the other account. I had actually overpaid both accounts and had a credit on my accounts for a short time.

I submitted a payment which was linked between my Capital One Bank checking account and my Capital One Credit Card. After several days the funds were not showing on the credit card. I inquired as I was concerned over the amount of time it was taking for the processing of the funds between the accounts. I wanted to use the specific credit card for my travels that began on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with several people at Capital One Credit Card, they called the Capital One Bank and verified the funds. They put me through several 1 hour long waits ( not an exaggeration ) several times over several days ( XXXX ). The credit card side un-linked the accounts, they then advised me to Stop Payment - I did not stop the payment. Funds were verified. I never had a series of issues with the credit card before. Needless to say, the issue did not resolve and XX/XX/XXXX, approached, and I was forced to re-adjust my funds to insure that I could rent a car, purchase my hotel room, etc. as it was abundantly clear that I would not be able to use this specific credit card for all of the purposes I intended and it was too great of a risk to continue to hope for corrective or completed actions from the credit card company in finalizing and processing the payment. 

During the call with the Representative on the Credit Card side that requested permission to un-link the accounts and later during that same call, the same Representative pretended that he never asked to un-link the accounts and behaved as though he had no recollection of making that statement ( on an allegedly recorded line ). At some point after the "" un-linking '' the payment was then entered as a phone payment unknowingly to me. The Credit Card account now shows a transaction for XX/XX/XXXX, as a returned payment. After several phone calls, no one can explain or acknowledge any notes from the series of activities and numerous phone calls between me, the credit card company, and my bank. 

XX/XX/2016 - I paid my balance in full. Also, I noticed fees were accessed to my credit card for a returned payment from the XXXX activity. I called and requested that the fees be removed due the issues stated above. I was told as a courtesy they would remove the fees. 

XX/XX/2016 - I checked, and the fees had been credited, the account showed the full payment that was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, and the account showed a surplus of funds due to over-payment as the fees were removed. However the account also was showing the following restriction : This account is currently restricted. ( Ref. No. XXXX ). I phoned and was advised that due to the Return payment from XXXX, the account had been closed, there is nothing that could be done about it. ( I spoke with XXXX and XXXX on XXXX at XXXX - my phone records are available ). 

This happened immediately after they received a full payment. No warnings, no letters/notices, just a closed account. I do n't know if this is a common practice or if this is retaliation because I advised during the XXXX problems that I would report my concerns and their practices. 

As it stands, I have an account paid it full and funds and a credit line that are no longer available to me without warning. I am happy to provide any documents of the account that you may need.

I am writing to the CFPB to determine if Cap One has violated my rights under the E-Sign Act and if they have not to question the impact of this business practice because it is definitely not consumer friendly.

Before leaving, I hired a dog sitter and her friend ( who had been referred to me by people I knew ) to watch my XXXX dogs at my home, collect my mail, and take care of my plants. I had given this person the key to my house. On XXXX/XXXX/15, I fly to XXXX, and did not arrive back to XXXX until late evening of XXXX/XXXX/15.

There was a charge for {$410.00} made on XXXX/XXXX/15, ( also when I was still in XXXX ) made through XXXX Online Catalog, ordered with next day delivery. Please note that I am a customer of XXXX, but have never ordered online or through their catalog ; I have always gone straight to XXXX of the XXXX stores available to me in the XXXX area! In addition, I had a credit from XXXX which I had just received in the mail a few days before I left, and which was sitting out on my desk by my computer for 40 % off. This coupon was used by the woman who also used my card. I suppose the bank found this somewhat strange that the person who used my debit card would also used this 40 % off coupon. However, I think that she was probably just trying to buy as much merchandise as she could with my debit card and therefore used this coupon as it was just sitting there, unfolded and open! I went round and round with Capital One about this charge, and XXXX of course disputed this. I asked Capital One how they could find that all the other XXXX charges were not mine, but that this one was?? THe other thing was that this item was sent by XXXX with no signature required??? That is strange in itself. The delivery slip ( attached ) says that the deliveryman was "" met by a woman ''. That 's impossible because I was gone all day on the XXXX of XXXX, 2015, as I had medical tests scheduled XXXX miles away in XXXX. I did not take delivery of this XXXX item, however the woman I hired was told to leave my housekeys under my mat ( I have since changed my locks ) and they were there when I arrived home early evening on XXXX/XXXX/15.

Capital One has refused to see my point of view on this claim so not am I only out {$410.00} for an item I never got, but I am also unable to use the XXXX Credit for 40 % off which is rightfully mine and was used by this woman while I was Back XXXX for a family funeral.

23018,23018,23018,Mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker","I called a bank to get information about rates and policies after an offer was accepted on a home that my wife and I were looking at. I liked the rates and costs that were presented to me by the loan officer, but however I was not ready to commit because my home inspection had not yet taken place. The loan officer then offered to get the loan process started and get my rate locked in with the condition that I would be able to cancel without charge if something turned up in the inspection. I agreed and got the process started. The condition that I would not be charged a fee if I canceled due to inspection issues was repeated to me on a recorded line. 

Our inspection took place a few days later and it turned up major issues such as a bad roof on the house and detached garage, high radon levels, old galvanized plumbing, water damage, and possible foundation issues. After a few days of negotiating with the sellers, we walked away from the deal because we were not able to come to a resolution. I called the bank to cancel the loan. I spoke with the loan officer about the need to cancel. He said to email him the inspection report and that everything will be taken care of. He also said that we should call him back when we found another home. I emailed the report as he requested and thought everything would be cleared up. 

A week later I saw a {$450.00} charge on my credit card by the bank. I called the loan officer back and he said he would escalate the issue to management. I emailed him another copy of the inspection as he requested and waited for the charge to be refunded. However, after 10 days no refund showed up. I called the loan officer back and left a voicemail. After a couple days of no response, I called the bank 's general number and requested to be transferred to a manager. I was finally able to speak to a manager who said he would look into things and would try to get the charge removed. He also stated that he would call me back the next day. However, I did not hear back from him, and still have not heard from him at all 1 week later. 

I called the loan officer again after not hearing from the manager. I managed to reach the loan officer. He said he thought it was taken care of and was surprised that the charge was n't cleared up. He said he would have his manager call me back within the hour. No one ever called. 

I emailed my loan officer again today with no response. So I am now filing a complaint to get this issue resolved.

24849,24849,24849,Credit card,Late fee,"This complaint refers to a specific recurring issue regarding the manner in which Capital One processes payments. My due date to pay my credit card bill is on the XXXX of the month with no grace period. However, payments actually made on the due date incur a significant late fee because Capital One says payments made that day are "" processed '' and then posted the next day. 

They claim a cut off of XXXX eastern time in terms of processing payments made that day. My contention, and I was told by the customer service person that this is a common complaint, is that if I make a payment on that date, whether it is early in the day or XXXX minute prior to XXXX, should be accounted for that day. Their policy, somehow written into the credit card agreement and no doubt buried somewhere in the mountain of fine print typical of cc agreements, is an absurd and egregious money grab. 

I asked that my credit card account and all billing issues be frozen until this matter was resolved and was refused. Also, credit card companies should be held accountable for these kinds of anti consumer practices. Some of us are smart enough to know that they have armies of lobbyists who allow them to get away with sticking it to us with crazy fees and penalties for the smallest mistake, but this is no mistake. If my due date is the XXXX and I pay on the XXXX, I should not be penalized regardless of their internal policy, accounting or cut off time. In fact, the cut off time should be moved to the XXXX to allow time for processing payments that were made on the XXXX.

I checked my credit report today and Capital One has now updated my XXXX report to reflect the balance of the returned payment even though they had already updated the reporting of the account at the beginning of the month to reflect my payments at that time which cleared with no problem. Consequently, this update caused a nearly XXXX point drop in my credit score. It is very clear that Capital One is electing to report the account at various times with the intent of penalizing me. They did n't choose to update the reporting when my balance was even lower yet they are choosing to do so when the payment was returned. This clearly shows that they are intentionally trying to damage my credit rating in an effort to have me resolve the returned payment ( which I have already done anyway ). This is not the XXXX time they have reported multiple times in a month. The account should be reported after the payment is due and not report again until the following month 's payment is due, which is accurate information. Had I not resolved the issue with the returned payment by my next billing cycle, then Capital One would have every reason to report it in this manner, however, they are opting to do so now before the billing cycle is complete in an effort to intentionally damage my credit rating and to penalize me.

For information regarding my initial complaint, which also involved my Rewards Money Market account ( hereafter, RMMA ), please see Case XXXX ( hereafter, Case XXXX ). 

A brief summary of the facts associated with Case XXXX will facilitate CFPB 's understanding of my current complaint:1 ) After making a {$230000.00} deposit to my RMMA in XX/XX/XXXX, I had, as of XX/XX/XXXX, not received reward points for the month of XXXX. Historically, Capital One Bank credited reward points to my RMMA within the XXXX five days of the new month. 

2 ) When I contacted Capital One, they cited a "" bank wide system issue '' as the reason for the delay in reward points posting to my account, a claim reiterated in a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that I received after this issue was resolved. 

3 ) This letter also stated that the computer issue lasted from XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Note that Case XXXX was actually filed two days after ( XXXX XXXX ) the computer issue that effected RMMAs was resolved. Yet reward points were not posted to my account until ~ XXXX XXXX and Capital One backdated this posting to XX/XX/XXXX. 

4 ) Finally, I know another individual who has a RMMA and he/she received his/her reward points during the XXXX five days of XXXX ( Note XXXX, below ). This fact appears to be inconsistent with a "" bank wide system issue '' - if the issue was "" system wide, '' presumably all RMMA accounts were effected, right? 

Onto my current submission:1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an unsigned, undated notice from Capital One Bank informing me that my RMMA was being closed. 

2 ) The notice did n't quite put it that way : instead, it stated that my ability to earn rewards points in my RMMA would end on XX/XX/XXXX and that the funds in the RMMA would be swept into a High Yield money market account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

3 ) I received this notice 53 days after Case XXXX was opened. Retaliation for contacting the CFPB? 

4 ) This notice arrived after a period ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) in which I had redeemed a high number ( Note XXXX, below ) of rewards points ( XXXX ). Possibly, Capital One 's attitude towards RMMA holders is, "" Please, send us your money, because if you do then you 'll earn reward points (! ) but if you actually use a lot of these points in a short period of time, well, that will make us sad and we will close your account in order to foreclose the possibility of future sadness. "" In terms of outcomes, I would prefer to leave my funds in my RMMA and continue to earn rewards points. Hence, I have XXXX questions for Capital One : 1 ) Are all RMMAs like the one I hold being closed on XX/XX/XXXX? 2 ) If not, then why, exactly, is my RMMA being closed? 

Note 1 - I omitted this information from Case XXXX because I had not received permission from my friend to include it in that filing. Understand that my friend 's points posted the XXXX five days of XXXX - they appeared in his/her account during this period. In contrast, my points did not post until ~ XXXX XXXX and were backdated to XX/XX/XXXX by Capital One. 

Note 2 - By "" high, '' I mean relative to my perception of my annual spending on my Capital One Visa, which runs around {$16000.00}. A brief explanation is required : the rewards points referenced above are earned in a money market account offered by Capital One Bank. I typically transfer these points to my Capital One Visa rewards account, where I use them to offset travel ( airline tickets, hotel ) purchases.

25882,25882,25882,Credit card,Credit card protection / Debt protection,"About XXXX years ago, i received a credit card of {$300.00} issued by HSBC, with 0 % financing for a year. I purchased insurance on the account, as I was afraid of being layed off ( I am an older worker ). I was told at the time, by phone, by the insurance company and HSBC, that if I became unemployed, the insurance would pay off my account. A month or two later, I was layed off due to my illness, and initiated the program, providing the information needed to both companies. When I returned to work XXXX months later, the program ended, and when I checked my balance, I still owed about {$300.00}. When I inquired with the insurance, they claimed that they payed out around {$30.00} a month for nine months, or around {$270.00}. When i inquired about the account with HSBC, they said they dropped the interest rate when they froze the account. Now if the insurance company was paying at least the minimum on the account, why did the HSBC change the interest rate without informing me? This product was sold to me with the intention of preserving my credit by paying on this account, and was misrepresented by both parties involved. To make this story worse, HSBC was bought by Capitol One. I discovered this after I got a call from Capitol One saying I need to send a payment on my account. I told them, I do n't have a Capitol One account, wherein they told me that my account was purchased by HSBC. I told them of the problems with HSBC, and they told me, that they had no idea where that money went, but that Capitol One purchased the account. I told them that I have already paid via my insurance on that account, and the amount owed should have been less than a XXXX bucks, not the {$300.00} they claim as the balance. They claimed to know nothing about my situation, so I tell them I am not paying them money I do not owe. Flash forward to today : its been years since that conversation, Capitol One has accessed late fees on a credit card account I do not own. This was then turned over to an odious collection agency called XXXX XXXX, after upping the ante from {$300.00} to {$500.00}. I have told these people for years I am not paying them, and will not. I may one day settle this, but its not going to be for {$300.00} or {$500.00}, it will be for the amount owed on the original account, minus the amount paid by the insurance. In the years between, I have purchased cars, and other items with credit, paying them off in a timely manner. Recently, I have left work again, due to my health problems, and have related this to XXXX XXXX, who still wants to collect for Capitol One. They wanted me to put an account of this in writing to them, but I have instead opted to put an account of this in writing to you, in the hopes you will forward the complaint to both Capitol One and XXXX XXXX.

What Capitalone does not make readily transparent is the "" great than '' clause they have for cardmembers. For example, I had a card with a {$2900.00} balance. The first month, the payment was XXXX ... the next month it nearly tripled to {$84.00}, even though the card 's balance only increased by XXXX to XXXX. I spoke online with an account specialist named "" XXXX '' who could not determine exactly where the numbers were coming from, so she transferred me to her "" supervisor '' by the name of XXXX who informed me that the payment was the "" greater of the two '' ... 1 percent of your balance PLUS interest PLUS fees or XXXX. I have never paid such a high monthly payment on a credit with only a XXXX balance.

27005,27005,27005,Credit card,APR or interest rate,"To Whom It May Concern, Good morning. Please, I am seeking help with inquiring into a balance that has become outstanding with the company Capital One. 
I opened this account 14 years ago in XX/XX/XXXX. It was my very first account to begin a credit history and this during my enrollment into college. I have diligently paid on this account and never in any lien for 14 years. I have already paid off the student loans years ago because their interest practices were subsequently fair. 
I have opened other accounts over the years ( car insurance, other emergency credit cards, etc. ) All United States companies. Every other interest-based company I 've ever dealt with in United States has, following my establishing a good payment standing, automatically lowered my variable-interest rates ( not my credit limit ) or continued seeking ways to offer me waived potential fees ( such as removing inflated operating fees ), to reward my good payment history, help pay principal and keep me as a customer. They would seemingly also do these so their federal and consumer-protection practices remained compliant. 
During all these events, I have never once for 14 years, been offered any reductions or adjustments or anything offered from Capital One. I understand it was my first card years ago. But, the APR is not fixed. Interest raised the principal to the point where I could not easily transfer the balance years ago. I then tried to stop the card. The majority of my current balance with them is purely, once again, interest. I have not encountered this with other non-fixed APR-based companies. Over {$1000.00} from multiple interest and other fees accumulates every 11 months for years now. Although, I had never made lengthy late payments to warrant it and maintained a XXXX FICO score all years leading to this. 
Please see then also attachment. The balance reflects not the small total purchases made with this card annually, but reflects totals largely derived from interest. 
The only reprieve came when current federal administration stimulus plan lowered and capped rates on existing accounts following the banking, automotive and housing bailouts of recent years. But, it was short-term. The administration 's regulations on banking expired ( seemed not more than 6-9months ) and the interest rate resumed. 
So, please I would request assistance because I do not know how to address the matter. Thank you. Please, I would like to inquire for any help checking into the matter, especially ( but not limited to ) of certain interest policies with the company Capital One. Thank you so much for any help you can provide. 


Best Regards, -Name omitted as per request of CFPB-P.S. The account is outstanding. Otherwise, I have XXXX liens or outstanding debts. The college loans paid off in-full all-closed. I financed then also a home since XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX 30 yr fixed-3.75 %.

27749,27749,27749,Credit card,Billing disputes,"I am being asked to pay a vendor directly for an airline ticket I purchased on XXXX XXXX with my Capitol One card, because Capitol One charged back the {$1200.00} cost of the airline ticket. I have already paid Capitol One for the airline ticket when I paid off my XX/XX/XXXX balance in full ( {$2600.00} ) on XXXX XXXX. I have a record of this transaction on my bank statement, but I can not access my credit card statements because my card is under investigation for fraud. The vendor is asking for proof I have paid from Capitol One, but Capitol One will not give me any proof because of the investigation. Capitol One has told me verbally that they will contact the vendor, but I do n't have any confirmation that they will do so. 

Regarding the Fraud investigation, I have already been on a conference call with Capitol One with my sister XXXX because we believe the source of this issue is that there has been a mix-up with our information. After learning that my card had been closed, XXXX shared with me a letter she received a to her home address in XXXX, XXXX, informing her that she had opened a Capitol One account. XXXX called Capitol One to report that she did not open an account - I opened a Capitol One card in my name with my information, but she received a letter to her address to her name. I live in XXXX, XXXX and did not receive such a letter. 

Here are the outstanding issue that need an immediate response:1. Paid Statement : Vendors are contacting me via phone and email regarding payment for charges I have already paid to Capitol One, such as a travel agency for the {$1200.00} airline ticket. The charge for this flight was on my XX/XX/XXXX billing statement ( XXXX XXXX ), which again, I paid the balance off in full and shows up on my bank statement. Capitol One needs to pay the vendors with the money I have given them when I paid off my balance in full. 

2. Unpaid Statement : I received a paper statement for XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX with an outstanding balance of {$1300.00}. I can not access this information online, because my account has been closed. Vendors from this statement period have contacted me about payment. Please confirm XXXX things : a. If I pay this balance, will the vendors on this statement be paid? 
b. If I can not pay off this statement balance because the account is under investigation, will it be considered a late payment? Will I be charged interest? I have the means and intention to pay off all outstanding balances in full. 

3. Confirm that the investigation is underway and a time frame for when it will be resolved. I was told that it would take up to two weeks for an investigator to be assigned to the case, which was opened on XXXX XXXX but it has been more than two weeks, and as of today, XXXX XXXX Capitol One said an investigator has not yet been assigned to the case. 

How is it that my sister 's contact information is linked with mine? When I called Capitol One today, they said that the number they had on file to reach me at ended in XXXX. That is my sister 's phone number. My phone number ends in XXXX. I am dismayed that the investigation is not yet underway even though it has been more than XXXX weeks since the case was opened.

I 'm being held responsible for 90 days for these charges. Feel free to contact me further to discuss this matter. 
Hello XXXX XXXX, I wanted to bring an important matter to your attention about XXXX of my XXXX capital one cards. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 my car was broken into and I immediately reported my XXXX card stolen. At the time of my call, XXXX charges had been fraudulently made. XXXX charges were made at the same location, XXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$200.00} and {$210.00}. The representative said that the charges would be credited to my account within XXXX hours and new cards would be issued. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX charges posted to my account. I placed a call back and spoke to a Fraud specialist. She stated to me that the reason the charges posted were because at the time I called they were "" pending ''. During that same phone call, I also gave the police report number as well as the phone numbers to the police station and burglary department. She then issued a credit for XXXX charges which cleared my account quickly on XXXX/XXXX/15. 
On XXXX XXXX, I got an email stating that my account was over the limit by {$7.00}. I was puzzled because the limit for that card is {$1000.00} and at the time of the email only had a balance of {$460.00}. Earlier that morning I used the XXXX to pay my XXXX bill which was only {$130.00} which should have left me with an available balance of {$400.00}. So my husband called customer service and was connected with a Fraud Supervisor. The supervisor indicated that yes we were over our limit because the charges we had reported fraudulent were frozen to our account for 90 days until the investigation could be completed. So my question to you is, how does your company declare ZERO fraud liability when we are still being held responsible for these charges we did n't make? 
My husband and I have XXXX lines of credit totally to {$3800.00} and have nearly perfect payment history with Capital One. After going through this process, it 's clear to us that customer loyalty means nothing and so once this investigation is resolved we will be closing all XXXX of our accounts and taking our business elsewhere.

I called XXXX to switch my outgoing departure airport from XXXX to any XXXX airport so that I could attend the Service. They told me this would n't be a problem. But they said I had to work through XXXX to process the bereavement waiver. 

I contacted XXXX and worked with them for several weeks, sending emails and making countless phone calls. They eventually forwarded the death certificate and relevant documents to XXXX.

But they needed XXXX to call their Online Travel Company Waiver Department to retrieve my waiver code. 

XXXX told me that they were unable to make outgoing phone calls and that XXXX needed to call them. So I called XXXX back and explained the situation. XXXX 's waiver department was also unable to make outgoing phone calls. So even though they had granted the waiver, these XXXX giant corporations refused to call each other in order to process the waiver. 

I was stuck in the middle of this. I even offered to facilitate a conference call to put these XXXX companies ' waiver processing departments on the phone at the same time. But XXXX insisted the phone call must be placed by XXXX directly. 

I called Capital One to challenge this charge, as XXXX was unable to process the waiver that they agreed to grant do to their inability to make an outgoing phone call. 

Capital One facilitated a 3-way call with XXXX. XXXX said they were willing to grant the waiver, but asked if I could resend the death certificate and supporting documents. I faxed it to them, and have a fax receipt to prove it. But they still did n't issue a refund. 

I called Capital One again to formally contest the charge. Capital One granted me an immediate credit of the full amount of the ticket - {$1300.00}. 

On XXXX XXXX, Capital One contacted me to say that XXXX had responded to the complaint. According to Capital One, XXXX claimed that my XXXX ticket was non-refundable. 

This is false. I originally booked my ticket through XXXX, not XXXX. I never agreed to buy a non-refundable ticket through XXXX. But most importantly, XXXX had already agreed to grant me a bereavement waiver. The problem was that they could n't make an outgoing phone call to XXXX. 

Capital One asked me to send them documentation of this. I uploaded my documentation to their website prior to the deadline. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received a phone call from Capital One supervisor XXXX ( Employee ID : XXXX ). He said they could do nothing because XXXX had claimed the ticket was nonrefundable. 

I reminded XXXX that XXXX had granted a refund. XXXX looked into it and called me back that same day. He said they had run out of time to forward the refund request to XXXX. Since Capital One had n't forwarded this request by the deadline. If they had processed the documentation sooner, I would have been fine. But they failed to meet their own deadlines.

28737,28737,28737,Credit card,Other,"I opened a credit card account with Capital One. I chose Venture card as it was the most attractive option for me. The most attractive feature of the card was the lack of foreign transaction fee because I 'm often overseas for work and other matters. 

When I applied everything went without a hitch, and I was approved instantly as I have an excellent credit rating. But when I tried to activate the card, the card was "" frozen '' for fraud alert -- I 'm not sure why that was the case since nobody from Capital One bothered to tell me despite my numerous requests -- and Capital One asked for my ID, SSN card and some kind of statements, etc. to prove that I 'm who I am. I was advised that it 'd take XXXX business hours. 

It 's been more than three business days. Nobody has any answers for me. XXXX of the reps promised to call me with an update, but they never did. I presume they have the recording of our calls. Their online help on XXXX is also unhelpful. 

If Capital One was worried about my identity, it should 've asked me to submit all the documents, etc. when I applied, NOT after I already got the card. Furthermore, I detest the way the representatives from Capital One would n't tell me anything, treating me like I 'm a scammer, despite the fact that I had to verify my date of birth, SSN and other information provided at the time of application. According to them, scammers know a lot of information about their victims. If so, they did they accept my application and approve it? 

I 'm currently overseas right now. I was hoping to be able to use the card and take advantage of no foreign transaction fee, but apparently that 's not going to happen. 

I also was n't given any promise that their system is secure and that my ID and other documents provided to them to verify that I am who I am wo n't be stolen off their server.

I would thank them and repeat to them to please look at the notes on the account. each time, the phone collectors would agree they see the notes. Yet this inconsistency started.

I informed them I would call back on XXXX XXXX or XXXX to make the agreement. Yet. I still continued to get calls. asking if I was prepared to make the payment. No one seemed to be aware of the payment arrangement unless I brought it up. Finally, I received XXXX call from an agent who was very rude. He informed me that I had to secure the payment ( basically I had to give them my payment information over the phone and they would debit the account on the XXXX of XXXX XXXX. He stated that my account would be going into foreclosure. And if I went into foreclosure the department may request all the money due at XXXX time. I explained to him, I was doing as I was told and waiting for the XXXX of the month to call and make the arrangement. However, I did n't want my account to go into foreclosure so I agreed and allowed him to take the secure payment over the phone. 
Since that time, I have been told that my agreement to pay XXXX was not valid, I was not XXXX months behind. I was four months and would need to pay XXXX for the next four months to be current. I again, agreed to the XXXX. Only to continue with calls reminding me of the balance I owe on the account. And that no agreement is on the account unless I can secure a payment. So here we go again. Today, I spoke with an agent who told me I owe XXXX ( this is only two months behind. Confused, so why am I having to pay XXXX for the next four months if I 'm only two months behind? This is very stressful, the inconsistency is not ideal for any business practice. If the agents do not know the correct process, why should I the consumer have to be frustrated during the process!

28870,28870,28870,Consumer Loan,Taking out the loan or lease,"I pursued the purchase of a motorcycle and applied for credit. Inquiries were made to XXXX XXXX of XXXX GA. When I considered the interest rate of the loan, it was too much.The loan was to be issued through Capital One. I notified the motorcycle dealer that I did not want the loan. They had already initiated the money transfer without my signature. Later when I found out they they had done this, I notified them that I would not be purchasing the motorcycle from them. Capital One transferred the funds to the motorcycle dealership without any signature from me. The motorcycle company cancelled the sale and kept the money ( {$7000.00} ). I have requested the money be transferred back to the financial institution. It has still not been refunded. I filed a dispute with Capital One in the fact that I never authorized the loan with my signature. The complaint was filed as a fraud complaint. I believe it was fraud because the motorcycle dealer never notified me that they would be transferring the money. Also, when I notified the motorcycle shop that the loan was too high and that I would be shopping for another loan, the dealer had the chance to tell me the funds had been transferred and held that information. All of these details were provided to Capital One and they decided no fraud was involved. I am not surprised that they would decide that because, I believe what the motorcycle shop did was akin to theft and I am sure Capital One does not want to acknowledge any association with criminal activities. A couple of key facts : I never stepped foot into the motorcycle store, all correspondence was through email. I never signed any document. I filed a fraud claim with Capitol One, the money source, and they disapproved the claim. I do not have the motorcycle and Capitol One has sent me a letter saying I owe them {$7000.00}.

The merchant, that is, turned out to be fraudulent. It is illegal for these merchants to do business with United States citizens unless they are regulated and licensed with the CFTC. Neither of them are regulated or licensed with the CFTC, but the merchants lied to me and said that they were. I have been making deposits to these fraudulent companies since XXXX, 2015. I only found out they were fraudulent when I tried to make a withdraw of my funds and they never sent them to me and after a few phone calls they locked me out of my account. So they stole my money! I had about {$75000.00} in XXXX account and about {$65000.00} in the other. I 'm only asking for my original deposits/investment back. 

Now, I originally filed a dispute with my debit card for these deposits as unauthorized transactions because the merchant was n't authorized to do business in the United States. Apparently, I should have categorized it differently. The debit card company investigated these disputes as such. The first dispute ( there were XXXX separate disputes about a month apart ) was found in my favor. However, I only received about {$1500.00} of the $ XXXX+ in that dispute. It was the XXXX most recent transactions at the time. The second dispute resulted in nothing. They closed the case because I had authorized the transactions. Again, I should have categorized the dispute differently. I tried to explain this to my debit card company but they wo n't reopen the investigation and refuse to issue any type of refund. This dispute also had around $ XXXX in transactions. 

Now, the reason there were XXXX disputes about a month apart is that it turned out that the same company owns both binary options brokers but the debit card transactions showed differently. So even though I was trading at XXXX companies I was basically trading at the same company. 

The total amount of both disputes is about {$55000.00}. And yes, this began back in XXXX of this year. I realize that 's 10 months ago ; however, I believe these are special circumstances because of the way I was defrauded. The company led me on for 10 months.

34438,34438,34438,Bank account or service,Deposits and withdrawals,"Hi, I opened a checking & savings account at "" Spark Business Bank Account online '' ( a new service from Capital One Bank, it 's a business account that can be opened online, but the downside is you can not deposit cash or withdraw cash from this account, you can only withdraw cash from ATM XXXX for my newly formed corporation "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and I began using the account and everything was good. One day I log in to my account, I wanted to transfer funds from my checking account to the savings account, because even though at the time I opened the account I opened a checking and saving, they only allowed XXXX XXXX checks to the checking account, so after it posts I transfer it to the savings account to accrue interest. So back to three weeks ago I logged into to transfer money from my checking to saving, and it came up a error message that I need to call in. At first the representative asked me XXXX questions to make sure I 'm not using someone else 's identity, and even though they knew I was n't and I was fully verified, they figured that now that my account has approx. {$20000.00} it 's the perfect time to put a hold in order to make me miserable, and going through such aggravations that I was very close to a XXXX XXXX. The rep tells me "" We decided to close your account since the {$10000.00} check you deposited was not good '' First I asked for an explanation what not good means, and I was not given XXXX, all she said is "" I also does n't know but this is what I see in the notes, and there 's nothing more I can do for you!! "". So I 'm basically now in a position where Capital One Bank has close to {$20000.00} of my money, and I 'm not being given a reason why, and they tell me they do n't have an answer for me what 's to be done next. The next day I call again, and I guess a representative with a little more feeling for another Human Being felt the pain I 'm going through, and she told me the reason is ( from what she can see in the notes ) is that Capital One has a feeling the XXXX check was either stolen or will be returned. I instantly called the company that issued me the check and explained everything I 'm going through, and unlike Capital One Bank that seek to make your life miserable, provided me with a copy of the check that it was cleared, along with a copy from his bank statements showing that the check was out. And I myself saw in back on the check that Capital One accepted the check and they have the funds. I instantly emailed it to Capital One, but as expected no response. So I called again for the next week every day several time, every time I was told I 'm being transferred to the fraud department, and after waiting 20 minutes I was told "" OH SORRY THEY TRANSFERRED YOU TO THE WRONG FRAUD DEPARTMENT '' and I was further transferred to a voice mail, I left XXXX of messages begging for a call back and offered everything in the world. I asked specifically XXXX times if I can go into a Branch, and not even XXXX phone call ws returned!!!! 

Bottom line, I opened an account, once I had close to {$20000.00} Capital One decided "" now is a good time to hold the funds, so we might pass the stress test '' and I was accused of not being XXXX XXXX, I was accused of depositing a stolen check, I was not given the opportunity to prove myself, and not even to prove myself in persona. 

I therefore ask CFPB to help me with this, so I should n't have to spend way ore on a lawyer to take Criminal Action against them, because if I do n't do it, then there 'll be thousands of people with money stuck in these accounts.

I was told an investigation would be opened and I would be sent an update in writing. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX and not only have I not received any information in writing regarding this investigation, I now see multiple new charges from the same vendors on the card. I had paid my last statement balance in full ( including disputed charges ) on XX/XX/XXXX since I had not heard from Capital One and did not want to be assessed late fees or penalties. 

Capital One now informs me that it will take 1-2 billing cycles to resolve the fraudulent claims and that in the interim they will not issue credits. So due to the lack of efficiency of Capital One, the consumer, has to pay unauthorized charges. Not only that, despite me having flagged unauthorized charges from vendors, they continued to authorize charges from these same vendors despite the card number having being changed. The explanation for this is that XXXX has updated the vendor with the new card number. So, to sum up, despite me flagging a vendor as having made unauthorized charges on my account, Capital One has seen fit to go ahead and without my permission update the vendor with my new card number and then had the gall to actually authorize further charges on the card. 

This is a travesty of consumer rights. I did not give Capital One any permission to update vendors when my card number changes. In fact, I want quite the opposite. Why is this being done? Is this legal?

I called again and was transferred to the fraud department and I told them my complaint and that I had never received the fraud packet. They informed me that their findings determined that it was not a fraudulent account and that 's why they never sent me anything. I also received a letter from the IRS stating that I owed money since the account was written off. I have been unable to obtain any information from Capital Once regarding these charges they allege I owe. I asked when and where the account was open, if they had my signature on file, I asked for a detailed explanation of all the charges. The only question they answered was that the account was closed in 2009. I have contacted the IRS and they are investing my claim as well. I maintain that this account is not mine and was opened without my consent. I have called capital one 3 times and I still have no answers. I want to know how and when this account was opened? A detailed list of all charges? They stated this account was closed in 2009, who closed this account? Why was it closed? Why is this the first time I am hearing of a debt to them? This account was closed in 2009 ... .7 years later and the only reason I found out about this account was because it came up on my credit report and I received a bill from the IRS.

I see my min payment amt went up drastically this month so I called Kohls customer service to find out why. They are stating my payments have been late for over 7 months! 
They have not. Looking at my payments, I have actually paid the account in advance, plus more than the minimum due. There is a problem between the payments being sent every four weeks ( every XXXX Friday ) and the way Kohls is applying the payment. For example : The due date is the XXXX. If my bank sent payment on the XXXX one month, it is properly applied to the XXXX of the following month. 
But if my bank sends 4 weeks later on the XXXX, it does not get applied to the following month. The next month 's payment goes out 4 wks later on the XXXX, and then they say it is late and charge a {$35.00} late fee- even though this payment is early. This has been happening for over 6 months and I never realized it as I knew I was making my monthly payments for greater than the minimum. So they not only have been charging me late fees for making my payments early, but have also been reporting to the credit bureaus that I have been late when I have NOT. I am very frustrated. I am sure I am not the only consumer this is happening to. We should not be penalized for making payments early. There should be a system in place to prevent this mis-applying of payments and charging unfair late fees to consumers- especially ones like me who have been faithful in paying every single month.

However, it is my responsibility as a consumer to make you aware of the illegal practices of XXXX of your companies who use your services, namely Menards, of XXXX XXXX XXXX. To begin in XX/XX/XXXX I was having my home remodeled and needed supplies. 
I went to Menards to purchase supplies but they did not have them and said they would have to be ordered. I gave them my credit card and paid for everything including delivery. I told them I must have these supplies delivered by a specific date. After calling them, they called back and said they would not be able to get them there on time for delivery. I immediately canceled my order and told them to give me a refund. 
This was in XX/XX/XXXX. The next billing cycle I received a bill for all the merchandise I NEVER PURCHASED AND HAD REQUESTED RETURNED and called Capitol One, who promptly confirmed my information with Menards. Capitol One said Menards said they had credited the account but Menards never did. Again, I called Capitol One who confirmed that Menards had not credited the account and suggested I return to the store I had visited, which I did. I spoke to an assistant at the desk who said they would handle the return Naturally disappointed, I called Capitol One back. They attempted to make contact and show Menards who had done nothing to credit my account. A couple billing cycles and a couple turns with the Capitol One resolution department finally generated a partial credit on my account. However, I noticed that Capitol One, had sent me yet another bill now for almost XXXX dollars! 
I again contacted Capitol One, who called Menards to ask what was this new charge? No one knew. Finally after a half dozen visits to Menards and over 30 hours of wasted time, I was told that by the way, that was a restocking fee I was being charged for items never ordered, purchased or delivered, since I had already stopped the order before it began! 
Again, I went to Menards, expressed my dissatisfaction and was told well, if you want, we can give you a store credit but we can not refund your account. How can they issue a refund but not a total refund? I told them me financing a store credit was unacceptable and they had no authorization to charge any fees to my account for canceled, undelivered products, which they did not even have available, causing my immediate cancellation. 
In summary, Menards actions amount to nothing less than fraudulent, deceptive and unethical business practices and it should be rightfully and hastily rectified in the interest of honesty and fair trade. If I may be of further assistance please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

I tried speaking to the credit card company, but not only did the person I spoke to have very broken english, they also refused my requests to cancel or freeze the account to stop the continued rising of the bill, regardless of payments being made. 
The only way to stop this from happening to the best of my knowledge at the time, was to stop making payments. Which I stopped making in XXXX of XXXX. I was then put into default. 

I originally signed up with XXXX as the credit card provider in late XXXX, then the creditor was sold to Capitol One, and terms drastically changed and so did customer service. My card was reported stolen in XXXX of XXXX, so XXXX different accounts are represented via my credit report, however they are the same account.

This is hearsay but courts granted Capital One a judgement even though they did not proof or have any evidence that I even own the debt. I have denied that I owed the debt since XX/XX/XXXX and no one from Capital One has sent me anything showing that I borrowed money or received any credit from them. They keep pushing that I owe this money but I have stated several times this debt is not mine and if it is please show proof. Within our court hearing the attorney that represents Capital One even stated they do not have any records other than the statements and the debt was purchased bulk with other debt accounts. They can not confirm that this debt belongs to me. They are just going after me due to old statements that they received when purchasing bulk debt. Not sure how you can say I owe something when you do n't have any type of agreement that says I will pay or I owe this money to you. The judgement was granted for Capital One to move forward with the collection of debt but I think my case was not handled fairly or even given due process. How can you grant someone money but the party that is suing for the funds do not have anything showing they have the right to collect. Capital One came from nowhere and just stated I owe the debt without evidence. They keep ignoring my request to show an agreement, assignment, contract, correct balance and it seems like the courts are working with them to collect this debt that is not mine. Not sure what else I can do other than to complain to CFPB due to Capital One continuing an attempt to collect a debt that I do not owe. Never had an account with Capital One and they ca n't even show that I had an account with them, where I made payments with them or even signed an agreement with them.

The appraisal eventually came in a bit lower than anticipated and Capital One gave us XXXX additional options to refinance without cash back. We had the option of a loan at 4.0 % with no point, or 3.65 % by paying a point and higher closing fees. My wife and I decided to pay the higher closing fees and take the lower rate. At some point, I received a promotional email form Capital One granting {$1000.00} off closing fees as part of their XXXX XXXX Event. ( My wife and I have Capital One credit cards. ) They agreed to the {$1000.00} discount.

( We received the letter on XXXX XXXX. ) At this point we had submitted most of the information they asked for ( Pay stubs, XXXX, assets, etc. ) and obviously qualified for the loan, but had n't signed the application paperwork because we did n't want to sign documents that did n't have the correct numbers. I spoke with XXXX from team XXXX on Wednesday XXXX XXXX and discussed with her how my wife and I could login to sign all of the documents electronically. I hung up with her, looked at the loan paperwork and decided to shop for the title insurance and settlement fees. ( Title insurance fees are listed as fees I can shop for on the disclosure paperwork. ) I found a local company that would provide the services for about {$1500.00} less than Capital One and called XXXX back within 15 minutes of our conversation. She did n't answer, so I left her a voicemail and sent her an email relaying this information and requesting her assistance using the new title company. She never responded to my email or voicemail. Instead, she proceeded to cancel our loan application. I did n't hear back from XXXX on Wednesday, Thursday, or by Friday afternoon, so I called her. She told me that had withdrawn our loan offer on Thursday XXXX, XXXX because we had n't signed the loan documents. I told her according to Capital One paperwork, we had 15 days from the time we received the accurate loan paperwork to sign the documents, and it had n't even been seven ( 7 ) days since we received the correct paperwork. I asked her why she did n't return my phone call or email. She did n't give me a satisfactory answer. 
It feels like our loan was withdrawn because we shopped for lower title and settlement fees. XXXX said she thought had previously agreed to the title and settlement charges, and I said I did n't recall agreeing to the title charges, but is n't my right to shop for the services? Instead of telling me that I would n't be allowed to shop for lower fees, she terminated our application, without ever responding to my phone call, email or contacting us beforehand to let us know why.

Oddly enough, Capital One also reported to the credit bureaus the vehicle was repossessed ( "" R '' ) as of XXXX XXXX, yet the charge off was reported to the credit bureaus as of XXXX XXXX.

After an online chat and a phone call with Capital One, I was informed that the offer only applied to balance transfers and did not apply to future purchases. Not only would I not have signed up for the promotion whatsoever had I known that it was only for balance transfers, but I also would not have spent XXXX in one month! I saved the promotional email which is deceiving. It explicitly states "" Want to avoid paying interest on new purchases? If you accept this offer, you can avoid interest on new purchases. Pay the Interest Saver Payment ( your minimum payment plus all non-promotional balances, including purchases, cash advances, fees, and finance charges ) by the due date each month, and you wo n't pay interest on new purchase transactions '' I do n't need a promotion to pay my credit card balance in full every month. I can do that without jumping through hoops to sign up for their promotion. This is the most deceiving fraudulent experience I have had in a long time! This deceptive tactic tricks users into signing up for a promotion where they believe their problems are over and they will have 18 months of no interest, so that after the users ( who probably would n't have spent the money anyway ) rack up a massive credit card bill, they tell you you must pay the entire balance to avoid interest! Truly unethical. This practice needs to be stopped. Companies like this are why the average American is in XXXX of debt. I lost {$300.00} balance transferring the amount away from my Capital One card onto other credit cards that "" actually '' are giving me 0.0 % APR. I will be closing my account ASAP.

Capital One gave out credit cards specifically to profit from the high interest, then waited to pursue legal action until the last possible moment, then waited 11 years to collect on that debt. If Capital One was so concerned with getting their money then why would they wait 5+ years to sue, then 11 more years to collect? If they 're so concerned with collecting their debt that they sue a poor college kid, then why have they consistently tried to sign me up for another Capital One card since suing me? 

I 'm asking that in light of Capital One 's predatory practices and continued disregard for the ability of the poor people they prey upon to pay back debt while still sending new credit card offers, that this debt be forgiven by the company and that all future credit card offers cease. 

Their actions have shown that, by continuing to offer more credit cards, they do n't need the money and they do not care about giving it away.

As I read Title 15 U.S. Code Chapter 41 Subchapter III Section 1681g, the victim himself is entitled to copies of the fraudulent documentation but must make the request for it in writing and must meet other reasonable requirements that can be imposed by the business which granted the credit.

Kohl 's made no attempt to send me copies of the bills that they supposedly sent me for two months prior to the final notice. I did ask Kohl 's to retract the negative information, but they refuse. Please see my original correspondence, their reply, plus my rebuttal. Since I do not expect a reply to the last letter, I am submitting my complaint as promised.

Last week, XXXX XXXX, we faxed them updated bank statements - the last documents they requested.

Since, as of today, XXXX XXXX, the Trustee 's website had n't changed, I contacted them directly and they stated that had n't received any further communication from Capital One since the request in XXXX for moving the date back to XXXX XXXX. I 'm interpreting that they had asked the Trustee to move it back approx. 30 days, which would put it on or around XXXX XXXX, 2016.

I contacted CapOne through online chat to try to get them to reverse the charge ( and the clock starting on the intro rate ) until I deposited the check. Their policy turns out to be even worse than I thought. They told me that it can take up to two weeks for the check to be sent out, but that, indeed the balance posts and the clock starts from the day the loan is approved. 

Think about it this way. When I bought my apartment, I applied for a loan. My loan was approved. But my loan was not in effect until the closing, when funds were actually dispersed to the buyer. 

In this case, they are calling it a loan and have started the clock when the check has n't even left their building, let alone disbursed any funds!

39518,39518,39518,Credit card,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"My complaint is against Capital One. Last week, I was a victim of fraud, but Capital One was not only ineffective at addressing the issue, they exacerbated it. I found out that I was a victim of fraud when I received a number of notifications alerting me to a {$4800.00} cash-advance transaction marked DECLINED from my Capital One wallet app. When I tried to log in to my Capital One online account to learn more about what had happened, the system would n't allow me to access my account so I called the bank. 
When I called the fraud detection number, the representative asked me for the e-mail address on my account, and when I gave him my e-mail, he told me that the information was incorrect and to keep guessing other e-mail addresses. It occurred to me that perhaps the person who had taken over my account had changed the log in credentials and the e-mail on the account. When I suggested this to the representative, he asked me to upload my social security card and drivers license to confirm my identity. 
Since I feared that the very information he was requesting over the internet had been compromised, I was reticent to send it. Besides, I was at work and did n't have my social security card on me. But I kept receiving these notifications from my Capital One Wallet app saying that someone was trying to get a cash advance for {$4800.00}, and I was nervous that if the thief had my information, they could find a way to push the transaction through. So I picked up the phone and called Capital One again. Since, in all, I had already spent over an hour on the phone while at work, I did n't have time to address the entire issue with the representative. But I notified him of the alert, told him I would discuss the matter later in the day, but as it was, I asked him to put a hold/alert/whatever on my account, and that somebody was conducting fraudulent activity. 
Not 5 minutes after I hung up with the representative, I received a notification from Capital One saying that a cash advance for {$4800.00} was APPROVED. I immediately called the Capital One fraud department again, only to be told outright that the previous representative removed an alert from my account by mistake. 
The fraudulent activity only occurred because the fraud representative changed the status on my account. I would have been better off not reporting the activity at all. Even though I reported the fraudulent nature of the charge within minutes of it occurring, Capital One has added a Cash Advance Fee charge to my account ( {$140.00} ), a charge that is incapable of being removed until the case is closed ( 90 days ). 
Throughout the next 7 days and approximately 10 or so phone calls, things continued to get worse. Capital One sent out a replacement credit card that never reached me because they sent it to the thief instead. When I called to report this, they assured me that, in fact, the card did go to my house but that they would humor me and send a new card anyway. When I directed them to the XXXX tracking number that confirmed that, indeed, the card went across the country instead of to me, they continued to ignore me. They sent another card -- again to the thief ( attached is tracking info ). By sending these cards to an address I had never been associated with, Capital One continued to put me at risk, even though I had reported fraud on my account. 
Finally, Capital One claims that with a bit of patience, all will go back to normal and I wo n't have to pay anything that the thief took. But I am currently applying to take out a mortgage loan, and the {$4800.00} cash advance has significantly impacted the debt/credit ratio. I have been told that this will not change until the case is closed ( 90 days ). The fact that a charge, which I responsibly did everything to avoid, stands in the way of me, my family 's house, and a good interest rate, is infuriating.

Around XXXX/XXXX/15 I mailed Capital One 360 the required form for a Trustee to Trustee transfer of the funds from a IRA CD with Capital One Bank that was maturing on XXXX/XXXX/15. 

On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called Capital One 360 to verify their receipt of the transfer form. They verified having received the transfer form and informed me it was signed, approved, and mailed to Capital One on XXXX/XXXX/15. 

On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called Capital One to see if they received the paper work from Capital One 360. 
I was informed they did not receive it and that the transfer form should have been mailed to Capital One not Capital One 360. I argued with the Representative that what she was telling me was incorrect and the form must be sent to Capital One 360 and they must sign it and then forward it to Capital One. 
She insisted that I mail a copy to Capital One which I did. 

In addition, on XXXX/XXXX/15, I called Capital One 360 and asked if they could fax the form to Capital One and they refused. 

On XXXX/XXXX/15 I received a message from Capital One to return their call. 

I called Capital One on XXXX/XXXX/15 and they inform me that could not accept the form I just mailed them because it was not signed and approved by CAPITAL ONE 360. which is what I tried to explain to the Capital One Representative on XXXX/XXXX/15. 

At this point I requested to talk to a supervisor at both divisions. 

After discussing what had transpired in the past it was agreed that Capital One 360 would fax the original form to Capital One today and confirm it by Email to me. Never received any confirmation. 
I would have expected at least XXXX of the supervisors ( XXXX ) would have folllowed up on my problem. 


Capital One said they did not receive the form from Capital One 360 because I had the wrong address of Capital One on the form, this is completely FALSE, because I put the address that Capital One gave me and is on all their correspondence XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. In addition, if it was incorrect Capital One 360 should of corrected it. 

At this time I have no idea when I will have access to my money. 

Banks should be penalized for not making customers funds available because of their incompetence. 

My funds not being available when due has cause me major problems. 

I have another CD maturing on XXXX/XXXX/15 and because of the new IRA rules requiring trustee to trustee transfers for IRA rollovers. I would like written instructions from Capital One on how to get my money transfer to another institution on a timely basis.

45487,45487,45487,Credit card,APR or interest rate,"We have been a customer of Capital One for many years. My XXXX mother has been responsible for paying certain bills to allow her to remain financially independent ; however, her memory has been an issue of late, and I noticed that the Capital One bill was not paid timely. As soon as I saw this I paid the amount due of XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). 

I reviewed to see why the payment was so high, as we do not use the card much and the minimum payments are normally XXXX. Due to the missed payment for XXXX and XXXX, Capital One increased our interest rate from 4.92 % to 29.40 %, effectively increasing the minimum payment from XXXX to XXXX ( more than doubled the minimum payment ). 

I called Capital One and spoke to several people who told me that per the "" Terms and Conditions '' they were unable to lower the rate on the card for XXXX months. However, it will be impossible for us to pay the minimum payment of XXXX. Essentially we will go delinquent due to this drastic rate increase. 

Up until this small issue, we have always paid on time. The fact that my mothers memory contributed to this makes it even more upsetting, as I can not now explain to her why the minimum payment has more than doubled, and we are on a fixed income unable to pay that drastic increase. 

All I have asked Capital One to do is put me back to the interest rate I have been at up until a couple of months ago. XXXX rate is robbery. We are good customers who paid in full once we realized there was a missed payment. It is unreasonable for Capital One to think that customers can pay such an interest rate, especially when we have been timely all along. 

My father went into the hospital on XXXX XXXX, thus I was not thinking about this bill at that moment, but as soon as I was made aware I paid the balance due in full ( XXXX ) I promised Capital One that I would put the account on autopay so that we do not run into this problem in the future if they would lower my rate back to what it was for years ( XXXX ) ; however the reps continuously told me that they were unable to change the rate, and that I would have to pay 29.40 % for 1 year before they would review. 

That is a difference of making {$1700.00} in payments in a year to {$4400.00}. All because we missed a payment and caught up as soon as I was made aware? I told Capital One that this account will go delinquent at 29.40 % -there is no way that we can financially afford to pay almost $ XXXX over the next year. Will they help us only when we go delinquent and ruin our credit? Is that the best answer? 

No, it is not. This rate increase is punishment for a late payment that is not in character of the account. It was a mishap due to my parent aging minds, and I do not want to embarrass them telling them that the reason the payment more than doubled is because they forgot to pay the bill. 

I am only asking that my rate be put back to what it was in XXXX. 4.92 %. We can then afford to pay the minimum payments. We can not at 29.40 %. 

Thank You.

I was not prepared for this as I have not lived here in over 10 years. In order to resolve that issue some bills where not paid on time .. which would include the credit card for which I have the complaint with. My account is up to date and even though my payment was late it was not 30-60 days past due which is what they reported on my credit which had a very significant impact and I am currently trying to improve my credit in order to be able to buy a home. When I called them to discuss this and requested that they show me a courtesy of removing the delinquency from my credit as my account was paid and is up to date and this was the only instance for which I was late, as I always pay before my due date. I was told that they can not remove the delinquency from my report as they have no way of reversing the report they submit to the credit bureaus. I informed them that I have spoke with the credit bureaus and know that they can electronically respond to my dispute I made with them the previous day and the credit bureau stated once they receive that response it will up date immediately so if I need it removed soon to contact the company directly. So again the agent continues to repeat annoyingly over and over we can not change what we submitted unless we made the error. They proceeded to tell me if I had a dispute I would have to file it with them personally in writing and mail it to their dispute center and wait for them to review and make a decision which will take 30-60 days maybe up to 90 days. I kept explaining that their negative report affected me within a minute of them reporting it and can just as easily reverse it, if they would be willing to extend me that courtesy, however, they would not. I asked for another supervisor as the one I was talking to kept talking over me and saying the same thing over and over, she then placed me on hold for 15 minutes when another woman came on the line I explained the situation yet again. She stated well since you admitted to being a little late there was no error on our part, I said a little late is not 30-60 days delinquent but irregardless I was simply asking for a one time courtesy since I have never had a late payment ever and as a matter of fact they were always paid early. She agreed that this has never happened before on my account but still continued telling me that I would now need to submit my complaint in writing and mail it to them, even after I told her that I filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency and all they need to do is respond. When I mentioned I was filing a complaint with CFPB she then stated now I have to transfer you to the president line and immediately did so, and where I got a voicemail asking me to leave a name and number and a brief description of the issue.

When he looked into our credit he told us that there is a judgement against us. We were not aware of this so I contacted the clerk of courts. They said that there is a judgement and if I understand this correctly they said the judgement went into a lien. They gave me information on the case so I contacted the law firm that is involved and asked them about it. I tracked down the original creditor because the law firm does not do settlements and the original creditor sold the account to Capital One. I contacted Capital One and they told me the amount of the judgement is around {$6000.00}. The amount that we actually accumulated on this card was a little over {$1000.00} and this is an old debt. I asked them why the amount we owed is so much. They said late fees, interest and court costs have accumulated but they would accept {$4400.00} so the lien can be lifted. This credit card was one that was being negotiated by a debt settlement company that we were working with that turned out to be a scam. Before this credit card debt could be taken care of, the debt settlement company collected their fee from us then disappeared. The law firm claims that all the information they got from this creditor was being sent to the debt settlement company which no longer existed. My question is, why did n't they then get in touch with us before the amount on this account got to be what it is??? This debt is many years old. I told them that I could not send the entire amount of {$4400.00} but that I would send it in three payments of {$1400.00}.

They were coming after me for over 2k and we tried to settle for a little over 1k paid in full, but they declined. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I did not have any kind of stable employment, I was a XXXX and worked on paying off my smaller debts and rebuild my credit. 

Last year, they tried to come after me again by garnishing my wages when I was working for a company called XXXX ; however, their request was declined due to my low hourly wage and part time hours. 

4 months ago, I started working for XXXX XXXX full time, and I am just barely crawling out of the hole I made for myself. After my mortgage ( house is in my boyfriends name only ), bills, car payment, paying our pet sitter, etc ... I barely have {$300.00} left for myself for two weeks for food and gas and to do anything fun for myself on the weekends, and now they are threatening to garnish my wages again by XX/XX/XXXX. If this happens, everything I worked so hard for, all the debt I paid off, the credit I built will be for nothing. 

My job is moving to a new location XX/XX/XXXX that is XXXX miles from my house, and I am trying to buy a house closer to work, but until then if my wages are garnished I definitely wo n't have enough money to get to work. 

If this debt is not 7 years old yet, it is very close to 7 years old. I will need to obtain my detailed credit report for the exact date since XXXX XXXX is limited. They are coming after me for {$4400.00}

This Adverse Action was taken without the creditor providing me any written correspondence of the my auto loan delinquency status. Although, I 've requested that Capital One Auto Finance communicate my auto loan details via postal mail. 

The reason I had to request written communication in lieu of phone contact is due to their aggressive and harassing collection practices. There were several phone interactions that I would have with their representative, after we 've made an agreement for payment at a future date. 

Their representative would call me within a week prior to my promise date ; several times daily, and demand payment in lieu of our payment plan. I 'd inquire if my account was notated with the promise for payment. They would give me inconsistent responses, either our arrangement was notated on my account and/or it was n't on file. 

This miscommunication happened several times, and several times I 'd escalate the call to a Supervisory or Management level. I would explain my discontent with their untimely collection practices for payment prior to our agreed upon promise date for payment. I ultimately requested only written correspondence per my auto loan details.

-Begin Letter -Date : XX/XX/XXXX2015To : OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT - CAPITALONE 360From : XXXX XXXX XXXX CHECKING CUSTOMER - ACCT # xxxxxxxxxxxxTo whom it may concern, I currently hold a Capital One 360 checking account with you. I recently reviewed my checking account transaction history online for the month of XXXX and noticed an anomaly with a particular check I had written for a business expense in the amount of {$90.00}. The check shows as check number XXXX and had no image associated with it. This check 's actual number is XXXX. I called Capitalone360 customer service to notify them of the error and to request that the check details in my online checking transaction history be corrected. I was told the details could not be corrected at that time, but I could get a copy of the check through secure message. I received a copy of the check in PDF format which I appreciated. However, my checking account statement for XXXX documents the incorrect check number of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Today, I called Capital One 360 customer service to see if they could correct the check details in the transaction history. I spoke with Supervisor XXXX XXXX Employee ID # XXXX XXXX whom reached out to the check receiving department on my behalf to see what they could do. After a long hold, I was informed that the check details could not be corrected and that check # XXXX could not be changed to XXXX. The explanation was that when the bank that cashed the check XXXX XXXX XXXX sent the cashed check to capital one, XXXX entered in the wrong check number which in this case is XXXX. I was told that Capital One policy dictates that check detail information received from the bank that cashed the check had to stay intact in my online transaction history and also on my checking account statement even if that detail information was inaccurate. 
I posed a hypothetical scenario XXXX. What if the Bank that cashed the check incorrectly coded the check number as XXXX? Since Capital one policy requires that information be kept intact when reflected in my transaction History and my checking account statement, would n't check # XXXX show up on my statement and transaction history? She agreed that according to policy, yes, XXXX would incorrectly show up on my statement as well as transaction history. I then asked that since Capital One policy states that statements ca n't be corrected, would n't I be stuck with a Bank statement that showed incorrect information for that hypothetical check transaction where check XXXX showed as check XXXX. She agreed that It would. This hypothetical situation is no different than the situation I am in now. Whether it 's check XXXX or check XXXX, the fact is that the transaction detail is wrong and I do n't have accurate documentation for my business transaction on my Bank statement. I explained the importance of accurate documentation for business expenses and Tax/IRS issues and requested that I receive a corrected statement showing check XXXX instead of check XXXX. I was told that CapitalOne policy prohibits statement corrections. 
I am very disappointed that your policy prohibits me from getting a corrected statement showing the correct check number and also prohibits correction of online transaction details. The only documentation regarding this business expense is a scanned copy of this check. Unfortunately the check does not correlate to my XXXX Capital One 360 checking statement since the statement is incorrect showing check number XXXX.

I recently moved from XXXX to XXXX, and have ended up with a late payment issue with Capital One. Here is the sequence of events. I called to change my address and was told that it updated my loan as well, it did not. I realized that I had not received a statement and called to inform Capital One that I would be making a payment, and at that time they updated my address ( XXXX XXXX ). There was a mix up with bill pay and I paid one of my other Capital One accounts. Thinking I was up to date I had no idea that anything was wrong. In the mean time, even though my address was up to date I received no statements alerting me that my account was past due ( I have not received any statements from Capital One ). On XX/XX/XXXX over a week later I received a call from Capital One collections. The caller ID was only a XXXX number with no reference to my financial institution. I answered the phone but heard no response on the other end. I thought it was a solicitation call. Apparently it was Capital One collections. They did not attempt to call right back or to leave a message. I was contacted at least two additional times by Capital One collections, but a message was never left. I feel that a message in this situation is a must. How can someone not leave a message that your account is past due, when you have a perfect paying customer, and have already talked to them, and in your notes you see that they said they were making a payment. I believe this to be very strange. There was another call made to me where I answered and the whole situation was explained to me. I made my payment over the phone, which has still not been posted to my account, and the wrong payment amount was told to me. I would have preferred to pay everything I owed. I also asked for a supervisor to call me back and have not received a response yet. My major concern is that this will effect my perfect payment history on my credit. Capital One had not talk tracks, information, or escalation path to address my concerns. Even if capital one is at fault they will not help you with the reporting of your late payment. They just inform you that they automatically report to the credit bureaus. This is shocking, because I work for the credit bureau, and this drives consumers to have to dispute things directly through their credit report, which is a poor way to handle a situation like this. Capital One needs a clear cut process of how to address consumer credit reporting issues when a consumer believes that capital one is at fault or has a role of responsibility in the circumstances of the issue. I have never been involved with a collections process form any financial institution, but this experience had made me realize that there is no real hope for consumes if something goes wrong, and that the communication of the departments responsible for alerting consumers and collecting depts. is very poor. In addition I am very concerned that there is not an easy way to escalate a situation with capital one, through their website, or speak to anyone above a supervisor at the call center. For someone that has never had an issue with paying, and has fallen into the stressful situation of moving to another state and encountering an issue with updating my information with my financial institution, I need help. From my prospective there is not way to mitigate this situation other that to contact a third party regulatory agency such as the CFPB. I hope that you can assist me with getting Capital One 's attention and resolving my issue, along with protecting the integrity of my credit score which we all know is extremely important, and something I have worked a life time to achieve.

50425,50425,50425,Credit card,Credit card protection / Debt protection,"Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, I like my Capital One products but there is a personal issue that is partially unresolved. It is partially resolved because Capital One was able to make monetary restitution to a credit card insurance scheme that I was paying. Capital One made misrepresentation of material fact by selling me products that supposed to cover credit card payments if I am unemployed or disable. I am currently having a successful career. However, I went to a very difficult time when I was experiencing hardship by being unemployed and collecting unemployment benefits. During those difficult times, I qualified for benefits as described under the terms of the Capital One benefits agreement. I was being harassed by Capital One on my cell phone to make payments. Some of those collection reps were condescending and rude. Maybe, it was a language barrier problem. They did not want to consider that I have insurance benefits that cover that type of hardship. 

Thank you.

When you ask for the name provided then a rep tells you that "" she is unavailable, but then continues to probe you for info. To me this is a clear indication that she is, but they just wo n't put her on the phone. So for that I am also reporting this company to the FTC. 
My New issue is that Capital one credited me XXXX do to an error on their end XXXX they passed the blame off to XXXX XXXX XXXX, but the XXXX only covered the XXXX plus XXXX late fees and not the interest I ws promised. i called in yesterday, spoke with a supervisor who fixed that issue just fine. I told her I had just made a payment of XXXX via XXXX Saturday and that I will call back with the reference number, so that they could verify and release the funds unto my account. I called back in with the reference # but they stated that because my account was "" past due '' and "" in collections '' that they could not. My account should have never been placed in that status because it was in dispute and accoding to the FDCPA If, within thirty days after receiving written notice of the debt from the debt collector, you contact the company stating that you do not owe the money, the debt collector must stop contacting you. The debt collector may renew collection activities if you are sent proof of the debt, such as a copy of a bill for the amount claimed by the creditor. And that until proof is given I am NOT required to make payment. 
Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you have the right to sue a debt collector in state or federal court within one year from the date of the violation. If you win, you may recover damages in the amount of any losses you suffered as a result of the violation, plus an additional amount of up to {$1000.00}. You may also be able to recover court costs and attorney fees. I am hoping that it will not come to this, but you will not violate my FDCPA Rights, you will not hold my hard earned money and you will not disrespect me Capital ONE!

In response, they sent me the XX/XX/XXXX statement showing i paid my balance in full, I paid {$10.00} more to be exact because of the return. The statement they sent me clearly showed that i owed nothing, yet they still claimed i owed the {$390.00}. I mailed them again requesting validation as to how a - {$10.00} balance turned into me owing the said amount on my account. They mailed me no such validation, simply a letter stating that their records show i owe the said amount and if i wished to dispute it i should send documentation that the account was paid off, which i had already done previously. I am beyond frustrated with this whole situation and their handling of this matter. Upon investigation if this company, they have had multiple complaints against them, including multiple government actions and subsequent ruling against the company for violations of the law regarding debt collections, attempting to collect debts from the wrong people and the filing of false affidavits in court.

At the end of the process I went to pay and it said the address was wrong, I tried again, still said it was wrong. That was the correct address for my card, so I went back and put "" n/a '' in the apartment field just in case that 's what I had put- and then it said that there were insufficient funds in my bank account. 

The order had not gone through, I went to my bank account, and I saw that the charges had been sent through and were pending on my bank account- putting a hold on that money. 

I called the cell company to ask for XXXX charge to be dropped and if my order could be pushed through on the other charge. They said no. I asked if they could reverse the charges, because I could n't afford the hold on both- they said no- to call my bank and have them cancel it. 

First woman I talked to with my bank said that they could n't do it without a phone company rep approving cancelling the charges, and that I might be held accountable for any overage charges that resulted. She said if they did that, I would have instant access to my money- which I needed because I had no cash on hand, and my stove is broke, so that 's what would feed me until payday. 

Called the phone company again and asked that rep if he could talk to my bank and approve the charges being dropped. The plan was drop both charges, go into the store and do it in person, and then I 'd have about XXXX bucks until payday. 

We call the bank, and we explained the situation ... that XXXX charges were pending on my account, I could n't afford that, the order did not go through, I was n't going to get anything for the money, and to please just delete the pending charges. 

The bank wanted confirmation numbers from the phone company. The phone company had said nothing had been generated on their side because the sale did not go through. I said I had some sort of confirmation numbers on my transaction report for the XXXX charges of XXXX, and the bank rep said that it could n't come from me. 

I told them all I had was XXXX and change in my account with the hold until Friday, that I had no food and would be forced to withdraw the XXXX in order to eat. ( which left me with XXXX cents in my account ). I said that this was n't my fault- the phone company 's site glitched and now, even with the phone company saying to release my funds, I 'm going to end up going negative and getting fees on my account because of it. 

This bank person said that I "" probably '' would n't be held accountable for the fees, but refused to guarentee it. He also said that the hold would last a few days, where either it will time out in the system, or the money will withdraw and I would have to go through the process of fighting it. 

The phone company guy tried again to explain that I was in need of the new service, and in need of my money- that he was giving permission to cancel the transaction according to what the woman said in the morning, and the bank person refused. I spoke on the phone from someone here asking for advice, they could n't find rules that fit my situation, so they passed it on to the FAQ people, and mentioned the possibility of a complaint.

I immediately called Kohl 's back and was told the process would take a few days if XXXX was actually going to send back the account.

I told her that was ridiculous and untrue, since that would mean someone in another area could then reason to call me in the middle of the night.

They said even if Kohl 's sent back that day they could n't try to get payment on it or take any payment. 

I called Kohl 's back again XX/XX/XXXX! The person I talked to said there was nothing else that could be done, that she could n't help me.

I was told that yes, they see the payment "" posted '' but they had not deducted it from my bank account. My minimum payment had been XXXX, but the XXXX dollars posted had also not been deducted from the XXXX. So, capital one had neither deducted the money from my bank account yet, nor intended to cancel the payment, nor had they cut my debt by XXXX dollars. The rep said "" cancel through your bank, because we ca n't refund it until we actually have it deposited '' and then agreed that, if I cancelled it through my bank, i would pay XXXX dollars today and XXXX by the end of the month.

They said no refunds ... ..however, there 's a small chance we 'll reconsider this once we get paid, and your minimum payment for XXXX is now XXXX not XXXX. I said this was a breach of contract and they said they did n't keep records.

After having the Jeep for almost two weeks, the Sales Manager of the dealership called my husband with a "" small glitch '' with the financing. At the time, my husband was receiving a small income from the SSA due to his XXXX. We both went to the dealership where we were told that he did n't have enough income for any of their lenders to finance his loan for approximately {$16000.00}. The Sales Manager insisted that we apply as co-applicants since I had stable employment and this would provide a better demonstration of being able to afford the vehicle with the combined incomes. Due to exhaustive medical bills after my husband 's XXXX, I knew my credit would have a negative impact on the application, and my husband and I requested to cancel the entire purchase - relinquishing the Jeep and asked for his truck back. At that time, we were informed the dealership had sold his truck and that we were essentially stuck with the Jeep despite not yet having a lender willing to "" buy the paper. '' The Sales Manager "" finally convinced '' Capital One Auto Finance to fund the purchase and it only increased our payment "" a little bit '' -- bringing the payment to {$480.00} per month. He produced a new sales contract and specifically instructed us to date the contract for the original date of purchase ... two weeks prior ... which invalidated and denied us with our right to a 3-day period to change our minds as buyers. XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I were victims of a bank compromise wherein our bank account was immediately depleted of any and all funds deposited. This caused our first payment to CAPONE to bounce, and we immediately made arrangements to cure the issue. For 3 months, we made XXXX payments each month. Over 3 years later, CAPONE is still reporting us to be 180 days in arrears, destroying any attempt to rebuild our credit while juggling ongoing medical expenses and financial hardships. CAPONE repeatedly called us while my husband was in hospital, after XXXX, while in XXXX, and even when he was XXXX. We have paid late, but have paid EVERY month since being conned into what we recently found out was a lose-lose, never-ending predatory loan. CAPONE has informed us that the type of loan set up was not designed to be paid off and if it ever is, we will have paid almost 3 times the value of the vehicle over the course of the loan. We have requested to have the loan refinanced, to which CAPONE stated they do not refinance their loans. When attempting to refinance with local lenders, they have informed us that we are in a predatory loan and that due to the majority of all our payments going towards CAPONE interest revenue, very little of our payments have gone towards the principal value of the Jeep, and therefore they are unable to help us. This type of action is derelict on the part of a financial institution and not within compliance of the federal regulations in place to protect consumers ' interests. One agent with CAPONE even acknowledged that their business is aware of the faulty lending practices from the dealership but said their hands are tied and we are essentially stuck with the vehicle, the huge payment and the irreparable damage to our credit as we struggled to meet our obligation ... and then asked when she could set up our next payment for processing.

Nowhere does that name appear on any of my credit reports ; I have NEVER used that name for any purpose or granted anyone permission to use that name with any of my personal information for any purpose.

We discussed in great detail the amount I would need to pay, in order to pay off the {$600.00} cash advance and stop accruing interest. I asked him very specific questions about my account. He said I would need to pay {$880.00}. I paid {$900.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called in on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX to see what would be available and a rep advised me the full {$900.00} would be available at XXXX, because I satisfied the cash advance. Only {$860.00} became available, so I called back in and spoke with supervisor XXXX, to discuss what applied to the account, and she said I would need to pay an additional {$47.00} in order to pay off cash advance. I stated that was incorrect and excessive. She explained I had a previous balance of {$100.00}. I explained that is part of next month payment which according to XXXX I would not have to pay because cash advance would be satisfied. I explained to her that XXXX and the supervisor before him gave me great detail on what I needed to pay. I did not have XXXX 's name and location at the time I spoke with XXXX. Once I found his info, I called back in spoke with supervisor XXXX and she requested I file a complaint in writing after XXXX told me she had already submitted my complaint. I am furious, as a consumer, this information is difficult for me to understand, but what do I do when the employees of the company obviously do n't understand, have no knowledge of their products, and are obviously not on the same page???

An online company charged my credit card more than a dozen times, more than {$2000.00}, without my authorization and after I had expressly forbade them to do so in an email. This continued for three months, XXXX through XXXX, 2015. First I demanded that they close my account, and they said they would, but charges continued to come on my credit card account, so obviously they kept my account open against my wishes. I demanded they close the account three times by telephone, and they blocked my account online so I could n't close it myself. I reported this to Capital One, and asked them to block payment to this company, but they refused to do that, which would have solved the problem the very first time a new charge came through. As an alternative, they offered to refund my account, and asked for documentation for my claim. I gave them written emails and pages from the online company 's website which proved that I had ordered them to cease charging me two months earlier, and I refuted with documentation every lie that this fraudulent online company countered with. But Capital One refused to protect my credit card from fraud. I had to cancel my credit card number to stop the online company finally, and now I have cancelled my Capital One account altogether. They do not care about their customers, and anyone who accepts a credit card from them will regret it. Capital One will not protect you against fraud.

54890,54890,54890,Credit card,Customer service / Customer relations,"My complaint involves Capital One. Originally, this was a GM credit card, previous to Capital One acquiring the account. Once this account was acquired by Capital One, I experienced constant problems with this company. There are several issue 's with this company, these issue 's have escalated to the point of being unreasonable. Formal and legal disputes have been made by me. Against my better judgement, I spoke to an representative XX/XX/2015, and reached an agreement with this individual. I gave verbal permission for XXXX payments to be automatically deducted from my checking account. ( I was told this conversation was recorded. ) And in fact three {$59.00} payments were deducted from my account, in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX 2015. On XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that Capital One had not honored their part of the agreement. I placed a call to the company, a representative and a supervisor, both admitted to listening to the recording, but could not explain why this company had not honored the agreement. I was assured that there would be a complete investigation and someone would get in touch with me, within 10 days. ( which never happened. ) Once again, I called this company and was told that a payment had not been received on this account in over 120 days. When questioned this individual could not answer any questions, she could only state what was on her computer screen. XX/XX/XXXX, an individual called my home, basically demanding a payment or a payment arrangement. When the situation was explain to this individual, he stated that he would put a 10 day hold on the account, so there would be no late charges added to the account. My payments had always been made through the capital one website. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was blocked from my account, which prevented me from making any type of payment. I made yet another call to Capital One and I was transferred three times, due to no one being able to answer my questions. Finally I was told to call a different number. A XXXX, informed me that my account had been closed, then charged off and had been put up for sale. Yet, he still wanted me to make a payment during that phone call. Capital One has flat out refused to supply information, that was formally and legally requested. They have lied during every single phone call. This company is unscrupulous, unethical, lying thieves. Yet, they seem to enjoy threatening, many attempts at intimidation. It is ridiculous how this company believes that they are beyond the law and can flat out refuse to explain and/or justify charges. This company has received a payment on this account every single month. This can be proven through bank records. Due to the fact, that I have caller ID, I can prove that there was no follow up call, to address my questions. This is just a small example of the most recent issue 's that I have encountered with this company. There are many more. My biggest question to the company would be, If in fact, Capital One, is a fine, upstanding, legitimate company who follows all law and regulations, if in fact they have nothing to hide, why have they refused to supply the detailed information that has been requested? I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not the only consumer who has experienced this type of treatment from this company. I am considering legal action, in addition to filing formal complaints with the Attorney General 's Office.

Becasue my card was declined I called in and gave them my SSN. My account was accessed by the agent and I wanted to update my address so this would not happen again.To do this I needed to answer XXXX questions obtained from a 3rd party paid consumer reporting company, whom I can not challange or verify. I answered the first XXXX questions so my next question was what street did I live on in XXXX TN. I declined to answer becasue it was over 30 years ago and I do n't recall.

He starts closing the account until I told him to leave it as it is, I will speak to corporate. But, how can XXXX close my account if he can not verify my identity? The whole thing is recorded. He would close my account without first validating who I am based on the process they just pushed on me. I make sure my information is updated and call back. I ask for a manager and get XXXX. Again I am told I must call back Monday since no one is available to allow access to my personal funds. HOSTAGE STILL. Capitol One 360 logic is every customer must keep a log of their entire life to refrence if this occures. A bank that online XXXX can not find customer service to offer when this happens to an account holder? REALLY? I told the agent XXXX I could validate the last XXXX XXXX transactions debited from my account since XXXX CARD IS CONNECTED AND STILL WORKS. I told the agents I could have my wife ( THE CO ACCOUNT HOLDER ) verify her information and mine. So, Capitol One 360 can not deal with a customer with XXXX Issues, Can not reolve issues when urgent verification is needed, can not issue new questions based on XXXX party FOR HIRE consumer reporting agencies, and as a result customers are stuck in the cold. On top of all this the manager XXXX was more than willing to CLOSE MY ACCOUNT until I stopped him without the all super verification. As a result of this I am considering a lawsuit to challange Captiol One 360 and its verification process when XXXX is an issue. My account has a specific pin number and the account was updated.

I had also requested paperless statements for several other credit card accounts ( including a Menard 's Big Card - serviced by Capital One ). All other accounts continued contacting me via ( automatic ) e-mail message alerts including "" payment due '' and "" statement available ''. Why was Capital One allowed to risk my credit score by failing to contact me regarding payments due and statements available??? 
In my opinion, Capital One failed me. We spent XXXX ( if not XXXX ) of US tax dollars to create the CFPB. I hate that spending, however, I hate having my credit score, innocently, attacked even more.

My wages were garnished, and the account was satisfied, and the case was taken off of the docket. Several months later, the funds were given back to me. I did not ask for the funds they just showed up. I called Capital One to inquire about the funds and I as simply told that the case was closed and the case was taken off the docket. 
Several months later, I received a letter stating that the funds were once again going to be taken from me, and I was being garnished again for the same funds that were returned to me! Only this time the amount was more than twice the original amount that had already been paid ( and returned ). When I called XXXX and XXXX, the attorneys handling the case, the only information they would give me is the returning date for the case when they pick up the wages that had been garnished.

For this verbal verification I went to my personal bank, called capitol one, and let them speak with a representative at my bank on my phone. The bank representative then gave the capitol one representative a phone number to call, at which point they ended the call on my phone and the capitol one agent called the bank representative at the number given to them. They asked the bank to confirm that I had a state authorized drivers license and to confirm that it was in fact me on the state authorized drivers license.

56577,56577,56577,Mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","I am writing to you with a very difficult situation that has befallen my wife and I during a period of living XXXX working in XXXX in a XXXX. The loan we have had from Capitol One apparently had a 5-year balloon payment and matured XXXX XXXX, although we thought it was a 30 year loan that simply went to a variable interest rate at 5 years. As far as we remember the loan originated with ING bank and since we are XXXX we did not have access to the loan documents that are in storage. My son was diagnosed with XXXX some months back and we have not tracked our finances as closely as we usually do, but this loan was being paid through an auto-transfer from a checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX and we did not ever think it would run into problems. However, when the loan matured, our auto-transfer was apparently rejected. We did n't know there was a problem until two weeks ago when my wife was contacted by her credit-monitoring agency with the information that her credit scored had fallen from XXXX to XXXX. We then discovered that there was a 30-day late on our credit report and that it came from Capitol One. This led us to discover that instead of going to a variable rate, our loan had actually come due/matured. Apparently Capitol One does not send email notifications of loans that are maturing, even though we receive other business emails routinely from Capitol One. We simply never received any phone or email communication that would have reached us overseas and we do n't know why your letters were n't forwarded to my XXXX who has handled our mail from Michigan while we were XXXX. In this era, it is difficult to understand how a bank in good faith could issue something like a balloon loan and not even send an email to notify a customer of the impending maturity of the loan ( along with there many other marketing and business related emails from Capitol One ). It was n't even apparent what had happened when we logged onto the Capitol One website ( we have screenshots ) and looked at our account. Capitol One has refused any possibility of rapid assistance other than a loan modification for people who can not afford their mortgages, although they initially told us they would get a rapid exception to do a retroactive rate extension. 
I initially spoke with the loan-servicing department a number of times and was treated not as the good customer that I am, but rather as someone who had had in bad faith intentionally missed a payment. I said that my primary objective was to get this loan back in good standing. However, I was transferred from person to person, some of whom said they could help refinance the loan, others who said it would not be possible. Ultimately, despite our good faith, I have spent the last 9 days on the phone, emailed and texted with many people in Capitol One including XXXX ( who made led me far astray over the last week by representing that Capitol One would take care of this and make the refinance happen and even originate a loan if we purchased a new property ), XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ( who tried to be helpful ) and numerous others and have come up empty handed. I was told that my credit will continue to be further injured as soon as 3 days from now on XX/XX/XXXX and that there no way that Capitol One will refinance the loan because of the 30 day late that Capitol One itself reported. All of this is in the face of a house worth around {$830000.00} and the remaining mortgage that was for {$510000.00}. In other words we have substantial equity, our credit score remains high ( at least for the next several days until Capitol One reports against it again ), we make a salary that is more than enough for the loan, and Capitol One refuses to make any exception and help us with this loan. People make small mistakes, but the consequences in this case have been disproportional and frankly devastating for my family

In their letter they stated "" Based on your application information, despite our attempt to reach you, we have been unable to resolve a consumer alert you placed for access to your credit bureau report. '' I did place an alert because my credit card was compromised. 

They also stated in their report that my XXXX XXXX credit score was XXXX, dated XXXX/XXXX/2016. Just below that they wrote, "" Key factors that adversely affected your credit score : Serious delinquency ; too many accounts with balances ; proportion of balances to credit limits on bank/national revolving or other revolving accounts is too high '' This is absolutely false. I do not appreciate getting a letter accusing me of false activity with my credit. A letter stating the facts would have been acceptable and I could have proceeded from there. I can not, however, accept the fact they are sending me a form/custom letter with false information. 

Nobody ever tried to reach me, other than this email that I was n't notified that I would receive. The key factors that you say adversely affected my credit score of XXXX are in absolutely false. I have XXXX credit cards. XXXX is paid off monthly. The other has a small balance, less than {$1000.00} out of a credit limit of {$7500.00}. 

I was denied a credit card by Capital One Venture Card after they nicked my credit twice because they said, via telephone, that the credit reporting bureaus did not have my telephone number.

It appears that Capital One Venture Card sent me a form letter of denial stating the above false information. I want the denial of credit by Capital One Venture Card to be removed from any credit reporting bureau because of their false accusations. I DO want a letter from Capital One Venture Card stating the reason I was denied, because as they told me they were unable to get my phone number from the credit bureaus.

I had an unsecured installment account with Capital One, while living in XXXX, opened on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I moved to XXXX on XXXX. I filed Chap XXXX BK in XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. This debt was listed in the BK. Cap One charged off the debt on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Last payment made to Cap One was on XX/XX/XXXX. They sold the debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Cap One has reported the debt as charged off/sold to another Lender, {$0.00} ( XXXX ) balance, ever since it was charged off. XXXX XXXX then reported the debt as theirs with a balance of {$5500.00} ( XXXX dollar more than the charge-off amount ), and is still reporting this same information. My Chap XXXX was dismissed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX due to documents not provided by my attorney to the BK Trustee, after I had paid into the BK for almost a year. The credit bureaus have reported this same information up until this month, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This is a time-barred debt that is scheduled to fall completely off my credit report in 5 more months ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Yesterday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I discovered that Capital One has re- reported this debt, as a valid, new debt, to the XXXX CRA 's, with a balance of {$5500.00}. I disputed this with XXXX and also with Cap One by phone, yesterday ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). It appears they ( Cap One ) did this on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Cap One says I CURRENTLY owe them {$5500.00}, and is reporting this to XXXX and XXXX. XXXX XXXX is ALSO reporting that I owe them {$5500.00}. I believe that Cap One re-reported and re-aged this debt willfully, and maliciously. I have contacted a consumer attorney about a lawsuit. This dropped my XXXX credit score by XXXX points, putting my score at XXXX, just below the threshold for a pre-approved VA loan that I have recently applied for, and was pre-approved for, a month and a half ago. The VA threshold is XXXX. Now, I can not purchase the house that we are looking at, because my score has dropped, and I no longer qualify. I believe this was done maliciously, and illegally ( violates the FCRA ), by Cap One, to damage my credit rating, and to coerce me to pay this time-barred debt, which they charged off and sold to XXXX XXXX. I am XXXX years old and retired now, living on a fixed income, so I am looking for information on suing on a contingency basis. My wife and I have suffered enough for the last 7 years and I would like to sue Cap One ( Federally, if possible ) and/or Transunion, for violations of the FCRA. I have been XXXX long years waiting for my score to come back so we can qualify for this loan. Now, that we have finally reached our goal, our legs have been knocked out from under us, forcing us to continue to rent and robbing us of the right to, once again, own a home of our own. I am sick of these people and their underhanded tactics. In addition to this, XXXX XXXX is reporting this same debt monthly to the CB, so that this 7 year old debt appears to be new debt. This has caused damage to my credit and credit score for the last 6 years.I will NEVER pay this debt. Do you think I have a case?

Today I want to pay off the balance transfer promotion amount. I called the company to get the amount and they advised.

This was never disclosed to me in any form or fashion. Other companies are able to specify which type of line the payment should go to "" Specify where my payments are applied '' for example, but this company does not. Furthermore, I was given the wrong date to pay that promotional amount off, which has adversely caused me to be very stressed as I intended to pay it off when it was due and not earlier, they said a date earlier. I called again and got another date so now I really do n't know when it is due. I called to ask for my balance transfer consumer agreement and they advised that they could not give me that either. I asked where the general terms are, and they could not provide that. It is not in the best interest of the customer to apply a monthly payment to the line of credit with the lowest interest or to a promotion amount before applying it to an amount with the highest interest rate. That also happened without my consent. Their terms for "" How my payment is applied '' state that "" Generally, they apply it in a certain form or fashion, I as a consumer need to understand what "" generally '' means, and how I can be satisfied by being able to make a payment to a promotional offer in its entirety without having to pay also purchases that were made afterwards that have no end date for incurring interest.

XX/XX/XXXX my mother called the Kohl 's credit card department with the intention of simply verifying that I was no longer associated with her account, as I stopped being an authorized user approximately ten years ago. There was a miscommunication between my mother and the customer service staff person that resulted in the staff person thinking I was never an authorized user on the account and taking action to make sure a letter would be sent to clear any and all credit history I had through Kohl 's. That letter was sent to the XXXX credit reporting agencies and my complete credit history through Kohl 's was deleted. This action was not what my mother intended and the letter that was sent was done so based on inaccurate information, as I did indeed have a credit card through Kohl 's. Prior to the letter being sent, the information on my credit report was accurate. After the letter was sent, however, my credit report changed drastically in a negative way and it no longer reflects accurate information. Specifically as a result of the letter, the Kohl 's credit card is no longer listed as one of my closed accounts and does not appear anywhere on the report. Additionally, my first line of credit has decreased from beginning 12 years ago to 9 years ago ( the Kohl 's credit card was my first line of credit ).

A supervisor in the Kohl 's credit card department agreed to work on providing me with all the information pertaining to my time as an authorized user on the account and contacting the XXXX credit reporting agencies to inform them that the letter was mistakenly mailed to them and my information needs to be returned to the previous ( correct ) status. I received a voicemail several days ago from the supervisor stating that a letter was mailed to my mother 's house with the dates I was an authorized user on the account and that he was still working on having that information provided to the XXXX credit reporting agencies. I was very pleased with this information because I assumed the correct account information was located and that my credit report information would be corrected. I then received the letter and immediately saw that the dates on the letter are inaccurate.

Even though I had financing approved through my credit union, the dealer talked me into going with a Capital One auto loan at a slightly lower interest rate. I asked the dealer if I would be able to make payments ahead of schedule and have them count toward future payments. I have always paid ahead on previous auto loans.

I attempted to do this, but the online site will not let me make a payment until my previous due date has passed. To me this is deceptive and gives me a course for failure. First of all, not being able to make a payment ahead increases the amount of interest they can collect from me. Putting additional payments only toward the principal and not toward future payments due is a course to failure. I could be the equivalent of several months ahead in payments, but if I am unable to make a full payment within a 30 day period, I could face possible repossession of the vehicle even though I am way ahead in my payments. I feel this practice is deceptive. It does not give me the option of paying months ahead on my loan and it seems like a purposeful ploy to get an extra chance to reposes the vehicle, even though payments are ahead of schedule ...

There is a blatant case of fraud here in impersonating a current creditor/debtor relationship to sneak into my credit report when no business relationship exists. I have never applied for any of the approximately XXXX bogus offers of credit. I have opted out before this was put on my credit report - in black and white on page XXXX of XXXX for CFPB review. It is wrong. It is blatant. It is illegal. XXXX clearly distinguishes this recent credit inquiry from others that are promotional in nature and which I have since opted-out upon.

Capital One bank is not fair by denying to pay us the accumulated cash rewards of {$2300.00} despite they charged merchant fees to vendor whom i purchased the goods from. 

If Capital bank is not willing to reinstall/active my credit card, then in all fairness they should : a.

I have not received my refund check which I requested 17 days ago. By law, I should have received it within seven business days of my initial request. 

XXXX. If you have a credit balance on your account, you can keep it or write your issuer for a refund if the amount is more than one dollar. Your card issuer must send you a refund within seven business days of getting your request. If you do n't ask for a refund and you do n't make any other purchases for more than six months, the issuer must make a good faith effort to send you a refund.

Documents proffered by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX are insufficient to validate the alleged debt. Capital one and by and through XXXX XXXX have worked to committed fraud by preparing and submitting false documents to this court with the intention that this court and I rely on the false documents to the detriment of me. 

They are doing this to many others as well have made billions doing so in the worst of economics. 

Their whole case is based on the inability of people to afford and/or be given the right to an attorney to defend such law suits. They also base their cases on defendants going into default and/or not filing answers and/or inability to understand their rights as well as such proceedings. 

They also filed this lawsuit during the holidays XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX with the same intent their tactics are that defendants do n't know how to and/or can not respond in time. 
I filed answer to the complaint and a response to their request for admissions to the best of my abilities. And at the same time I responded to admissions I requested production of documents, admissions, and/or interrogatories. 

Their response was they did not receive it and/or the same tactics as to file a motion with no time to respond a few days prior to the current court date of XXXX XXXX 2015. 
Capital One Bank on the false documents has severely damaged my ability to support myself and my credit ratings and/or obtain money and/or property and/or to consolidate my debt. And now are helping these racketeers to committed fraud by preparing and submitting a known false document to this court with the intention that I rely on the false document to deprive me of my rights. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is an affiliate of XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are a debt buyer typically of defaulted credit card accounts, purchasing them for pennies on the dollar in order to collect on them. They have been known to sue consumers to collect on these purchased debts and allegedly coerced debtors to pay using illegal tactics violating the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 
The fantasy that the debt-buyer system is keeping the cost of credit down evaporatedwhen the bank decided to sell off the debt at a fraction of its face value. 
Assume the following scenario which, for the sake of simplicity of illus-tration, will use simple, rather than compound interest : on XXXX XXXX, a consumer owes {$1000.00} on her credit card, all of which is principal and does not include any interest, late fees or other fees. She fails to pay her credit card bill, and never makes another payment. What happens? On XXXX XXXX, she will receive a bill for the {$1000.00}, plus 29.99 % interest based on the annual percent-age rate, plus a late fee for {$39.00}. She will continue to receive these charges for the next 5 months ( for a total of 6 months, or 180 days until the creditor will "" charge off '' the account for tax purposes ). By this time, the bill will be approx-imately {$1300.00}, or almost 40 % higher than it was on the day that she defaulted. This {$1000.00} loan, which now includes an extra {$400.00} tacked on since the day the consumer stopped paying, will be sold for {$56.00} ( assuming a sales price of 4 cents on the dollar ), and the consumer will then be sued by a debt buyer for {$1400.00}, plus attorneys ' fees of 15 %, or {$210.00}. ( This assumes they will not also be seeking prejudgment interest of 29.99 % ). For the consumer, the price of de-faulting has suddenly become 161 % of the principal of the amount loaned. For the debt buyer who invested {$56.00}, the potential return on investment is 2,800 % ; {$56.00} invested and {$1600.00} returnedPlease let me know if you needed anything.

61433,61433,61433,Credit card,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"I had a Capital One credit card, ending in XXXX, with an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX, show up on my credit report as being delinquent due to a purchase at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for around {$25.00}, total due showing as {$89.00} due to late fees and interest charges. 

After seeing this information on my credit report, and that it had dropped by credit score by nearly XXXX points, I contacted Capital One to discuss the matter. I told them that I had not used the card in close to 8 years and that the card had expired on XX/XX/XXXX. They were also able to confirm this. I also had never renewed the card when it expired on XX/XX/XXXX. Certainly the account would have been automatically closed within nearly a 4 year timespan of the card expiring as well. 

Not only did I not make any purchases with the Capital One card for nearly 8 years, on the date of the transaction, I was in the hospital with my with my wife and XXXX daughter who was born at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Capital One advised me that it was an actual credit card swipe on location at a XXXX XXXX store. While I can imagine a credit card purchase being done online using an expired credit card, the expiration date is coded into the magnetic strip which would not process at any modern POS credit card processor. 

I was prompted to look at my credit report due to the fact that I was denied a credit card that I had recently applied for. This never happens as I have an excellent credit score. This is when I noticed that Capital One was reporting this card as delinquent. 

Capital One should never have authorized any transaction on an expired account/credit card. Not only did they allow the transaction to process, but it was done so fraudulently. As a result, they reported inaccurate information to the credit bureaus which has directly affected my ability to obtain credit. 

Capital One did not directly address the issue of why the transaction was allowed to occur, but they did state that they will send me out a fraud application to fill out and I will receive notice of their pending investigation. 

I believe that the fraud application is a moot issue due to the fact that the credit card transaction should not have been allowed to occur in the first place, however, I will fill it out and return it per their instructions. 

The credit card I was denied because of the derogatory remark from Capital One was having a promotion that if you signed up for the card, you would get {$100.00} credit on the issuer 's website. I am seeking {$100.00} in compensation.

Each month Capital One claimed the information I sent as proof was n't good enough, or they did n't receive the proof of payments or they gave me the run around with what might have happened to my payments. For each payment they claimed they did n't receive I sent the exact proof they requested. This remained a revolving unsettled issue, so In XXXX XXXX, I called Capital One to get the payoff amount ( minus the disputed payments I had already paid and sent proof of payment ) I paid the payoff amount that was given to me by the Capital One representative and I closed my account. 

Just as recently as today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) I called Capital One to see the status of the most recent information I uploaded and emailed via the link Capital One provided to me. I was told by XXXX XXXX Account Supervisor, in the payment investigations department, that the proof of payment received for the XXXX XXXX, XXXX payment was able to be traced with the information I provided, but the other payments were not able to be traced. This does not make any sense considering the proof of payments I sent contained all the same information as the XXXX XXXX XXXX proof of payment. After she told me this newest information I questioned why the other payments could not be traced, she put me on hold for over 25 minutes and then I was disconnected by fault of Capital One. 

Please advise me on what to do next to resolve this issue.

I am told not to pay on principle since doing so will only shorten the loan duration but not the interest charges in the following month. 

This complaint is specific to Capital One. I was told by multiple licensed employees that principle payments do not reduce scheduled interest charges in the following month and discouraged extra payments. I eventual pushed the issue to the fourth level of management who stated correctly that principle payments do reduce the following month interest charges. They stated they would provide training to their employees. I stated I would call after XXXX month and ask the same question to see if the training was effective. 

Today, XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX. I asked "" If I pay an extra {$10.00} in month XXXX, will the interest charge in month XXXX drop by a few cents? '' He replied no. He said the interest charges would be the same as though no principle was paid and only the length of my loan would be reduced. He clearly failed my test and when I asked to speak to management I was told there was none available, then transferred to a voicemail. 

I have spoken to many people in the industry and it sickens me that so many actively discourage early pay off and additional principle payments. They lie to prevent early pay-off and this costs consumer XXXX of dollars. over the life of the loan.

62909,62909,62909,Debt collection,Disclosure verification of debt,"I thought I had submitted a dispute to the creditor 's response. For an unknown reason my complaint shows undisputed with CFPB. 
This is to dispute Capita One response to case number XXXX and add matters not included in the original complaint. 
The bank claims that there are no records indicating that a payment plan was agreed. The plan consisted of monthly payments of {$190.00} for six months and then the account was going to be placed on a permanent payment plan. The bank 's response is not credible since the bank has records of all calls and they indicate when they call or is called by the consumer that all calls are recorded. I spoke with collection officers in several occasions. The bank should be asked to produce the telephone records for the call when the first payment for {$190.00} was made. The record would should that that amount was established by the bank to provide a period of performance before the account was to be permanently placed on a payment plan. 
The records will also show that I was advised to make a minimum payment before the account was 180 days to prevent charge off. I made the payments before the 180 days. The account never became 180 days past due. The record will show that a delay by the bank in posting a payment resulted in the charged off of the account. In addition, the bank should provide a copy of their internal policy ( which they quoted several times ) that requires charge only when when the account becomes 180 days past due. The account never became 180 days past due. 
The bank failed to address the violations of the Truth in Lending Act and Fair credit Reporting Act cited in the complaint. It appears that the bank is hiding these records to conceal a violation of these regulations. 
New information not included in the original complaint. 
The bank used unfair and deceptive acts and practices. It was unknown to me that at the time I was talking to someone I taught represented Capital One I was dealing with a collection agency. In violation of the FDCPA the debt collector, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, did not disclose at the time they stated calling me that they are a debt collector. XXXX XXXX is a debt collector owned by Capital One. Capital One deceptive acts includes the use of debt collectors such as XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, to collect on defaulted credit card accounts, but it calls these debt collectors a "" servicer '' of the account and pretends that the account is not in default in order to get around FDCPA liability. Their deceptive practice includes the use of letters that look like they are coming from Capital One Bank, including the Capital One logo. 
Capital One Services discloses in the small print, that they are a debt collector, but they only do that after they have made several calls and after reaching and agreement with the creditor. The letter containing the terms of the agreement is the first time they disclose that they are debt collector. In addition, the letter indicating the terms of the agreement is made written with the intention to deceive since they make it look like it is from Capital One Bank. Failure to disclose that Capital One is a debt collector is a violation of the FDCPA.

63205,63205,63205,Consumer Loan,Managing the loan or lease,"Capital One Auto Finance provided a statement regarding erroneous 30 day lates on my credit report and attached a transaction history of my payments covering the time period in question. 
In their response Capital One states that the purpose of an extension is to keep the account current, catch up on payments and avoid negative impacts on credit. However, on that log, in regards to the XXXX 2012 payment extension ( the payment I needed extended ), Capital One mistakenly entered in that I could get an extension if I paid {$790.00}! This is a gross error because {$790.00} would have made the account current and there would not be any need for a payment extension. For example if someone asks for more time to payback {$100.00} and the XXXX owed replies "" Sure, just give me {$100.00} and I 'll give you more time '' that would be deceptive and insincere. 
Similarly, Capital One Auto 's response as demonstrated by their own records is equally unfair and insincere. 
I only needed XXXX 's payment to be extended ( due to a financial hardship ) for my account to be free from any 30 day lates and the extension granted in XXXX 2012 should have happened in XXXX 2012. Capital One made a mistake. 
The proof lies in the transaction record which Capital One Auto Finance provided. 
In XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX 2012 I only made the normal payment required, nothing additional. I had not done anything different since missing the XXXX 2012 payment, yet I was contacted in XXXX 2012 by Capital One and the rep told me that my extension was going to be processed and that I did not have to make any additional payments. Since I had n't made any additional payments, why is it that in XXXX XXXX when my account was a month behind ) I was n't required to pay anything more than XXXX 's payment of {$400.00} but in XXXX I was being required to pay {$790.00}? This again proves my point which is that I only needed XXXX 's payment of {$400.00} to be extended. Also, if I could have paid {$400.00} in XXXX then I would not have needed an extension. Somewhere between XXXX and XXXX, Capital One finally corrected the problem and my account was back in good standing but they penalized me for the error that occurred on their end. The attached statements clearly prove that the Capital One representative who entered the information regarding the XXXX 2012 extension simply made a mistake. The individual from Capital One Auto Finance who provided the attached transaction log, failed to notice and correct the discrepancy. As such my credit report must be immediately corrected and updated by removing the 30 day lates from Capital One Auto Finance on my credit report. The data furnisher has also failed to correct the error within the statute of limitation set forth by law and, according to the FCRA, also constitutes the immediate removal of this errant misreporting. 
Attached is the transaction log which is below the insufficient response from a Capital One representative who clearly ignored the facts evidenced by the records she supplied.

They say they have a fraud protection department but I have been fraudulently charged at least XXXX and never contacted by them. The XXXX incident occurred XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX of my cards was charged about XXXX times by someone who charged between {$50.00} and {$150.00} each time over a XXXX period using several foreign banks. Just by chance, I discovered the charges and took the information to my local Capital One Bank branch. They agreed that fraud had occurred and immediately contacted their main office. Granted, over the course of time most of my money was returned but why was I never contacted by the Capital One Fraud Department? And more importantly why was I never put on a watch list at Capital One as a client where fraud has previously occurred ; had this been done perhaps the XXXX/XXXX incident would never have occurred. In this day and age such a list is important, as an example Homeland Security just yesterday informed me that my personal information had once again been compromised. I regard the Capital One Bank Fraud Department as a terrible service! 

The next time occurred XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX ( XXXX ), a company that specializes in fraud charged to XXXX of my credit cards. When first contacted by XXXX I was looking for some training plus they knew I had made some recent investments. In retrospect I should have asked where they found out I had made an investment but it has been reported on TV news that banks such as Capital One make lots of money selling this information. At any rate I agreed to the training which had been tailored to my needs. The XXXX salesman said he had sent me by e-mail ( he already had this info ) a copy of the training service that we had just discussed and asked me to sign it. Under the pressure of him still on the line "" my bad '' is signed his e-mail. Later I found out that the email had very little to do with training but was a contract where XXXX promised nothing but a QC Code and a Virtual Platform both available for FREE on the internet. So I agree I was scammed by that XXXX move but surprised by the reaction of Capital One Bank. 

When I agreed to the Training from XXXX I used XXXX of my Capital One credit cards but it had limited funds. I informed XXXX of this fact and explained that only {$1400.00} could be charged at this time and since this agreement was only for training that when this amount had been used up that perhaps I would have additional funds for use to complete the training. After the fact, I later discovered that XXXX had again contacted Capitol One Bank and they agreed to allow an additional charge that overran that card by {$1100.00}. When I contacted XXXX XXXX, assigned by Capital One to operate on their behalf, she informed me by letter that "" even if there is not enough available credit on a credit card that Capital One may honor transactions above the credit limit! '' She also stated that "" Capital One complies with all Federal Guide Lines '' and that these guidelines are "" fair to both the card member and the merchant! '' Since Capital One make a lot of money by charging the cardholder for overcharges this to me is clearly a "" conflict of interest '' and totally not fair to cardholder. Never did I give either IR nor Capital One the right to make this XXXX charge, I have asked XXXX to provide me a document signed by me allowing Capital One without impunity to make such charges and so far has refused this request. 

I have also contacted the XXXX ( XXXX ) about this matter and of course they protect their subscriber. The XXXX advertises that they "" inform the consumer about the practices of their members.

By this to simply state, is there any reason credit card solicitors need to shove scout companies at me and probably any other citizens? These evidence in question is merely the demand to place exceedingly high interest rates on our citizens, mainly at young folks and those who are so down and out. 
It seems as though the clause is to be of "" a hand of aid '' or to word pre approved of which in testing that water it is not pre approved at all. 
Now to look the fullness of request, what is thee protection against over taxing? 
Therefore, espionage in these credit companies need to be slapped in thier power and greedy faces. 
How dare these credit card folks angle in this country to prey apon the needs of our youth. 
How dare these credit card folks go after our veterans. 
How dare these credit card folks call their conduct a freedom to do what ever they want plus change the rules. To benefit themselves. 
How many of these credit card folks are unionized to call it "" keeping it in the family ''. 
All terms that do not lay out in fair business practices and respects our Americam Values should be in question. 
Most of all, women attacking other women. Labeling of citizens without definite causes as in calling people forgetful, stupid, and incapable. Disrespect of our older citizens. No regards for life. 
Now do you see the full problems. 
How can anyone just snoop as another angle to attack a citizen? 
Who runs these credit card companies? I have heard some acceptable phrases on groups of creditors as being shroud, determined, and effective when this is all a form of AGRESSORS OF POWER. 

So, again why does it need to be complains about when espionage is obvious. You need to get on the real issues at hand. If not then you are apart of espionage and power channeling out of greed yourselves. 
AMERICA 's debt is interest groups accomplished gains. Not American at all. 
I have all ready told XXXX creditors they need to fix thier problems not attack thier customers. How difficult is it not to bring minds together who are exposed to the effects of debt and gain insights for solutions? 
What causes debt is not always over spending either. Who does not grasp that XXXX. 
It also is the lack of life in all people. It amazes me that after a full days work for a paycheck folks go home and lay around. No sense of being involved in how to save money at all. So I am not trying to be over stating the fullness of debt problems but start finding ways to communicate to adults that life is not all partying this town I reside in has absolutely no drive for life other than pay someone to do the work outside their work place. Because we only work for a paycheck and This is foreign mindset big time. 
Punishing people like they are children is not appropriate either. Creditors do not see slander in what this credit rating scoring really does. XXXX sees ID theft I see defamation of character to place on what is not happening. Stacking on high interest rates as a punishment is senseless all around. XXXX.

My issue is that the bank knowingly allowed these payments because the company who submitted the XXXX checks initially submitted a little over XXXX to the bank and they sent that back then the company split the payments into three checks and the bank accepted XXXX of them when there was not enough money to cover either of them at the time. So, I could n't bring my account current at that time due to other transactions coming out of my account so I paid it off slowly via my direct deposits from work and since it went over 30 days they charged off the account but did not close it because my direct deposits were still going to that account so I finally reached the payoff/charged off amount on XXXX and I am waiting on them to release my account back to full servicing but in the meanwhile, I wanted to send this complaint because had they not accepted those XXXX checks on the same day I would not have been charges so many fees and gone through this ordeal.

All three of my credit reports displayed 0 reports on my public records. Then the representative suggested checking with DOJ or FBI or to hire an attorney because they had accurate information. So I saved up some money and retained as counsel The XXXX Law Group. No information was obtained by the law firm during their research and later an Engagement letter along with a signed Authorization Form by me was sent to CapitalOne around XX/XX/XXXX.

Last year, I retained the XXXX XXXX Firm hoping to get more information about this legal action being that this firm worked with credit issues and the previous one was criminal, and still none was given.

67750,67750,67750,Credit card,Other,"Kohl 's unfairly and inaccurately utilizes credit reporting practices. 
After opening an account, I never received a statement. I never received even received the card. 
I made a large in store return which returned back to the card and their in store representative told me the account was a XXXX balance. 
A few months later I check my credit and notice a late charge from Kohl 's. Again, I never received any notification from them. No emails, no statements, nothing that would advise me that there was a balance or a payment due. 

I called to dispute and was told there was a balance and payment past due to which I paid off immediately. 

I asked their rep for their terms and conditions to which she responded, they are not available online, they need to be mailed to each person and they are different for every single customer. 

I continued to dispute the charge sending another email and got a call from bethany at the office of the president. She continued to say that they have no record of statements being returned so they would not remove the mark. 

They do NOT send any notification that they are reporting you. They do not PROPERLY communicate balances owed to their customers. They do NOT express due diligence with their customers to inform them of account status. 

After further review, there are THOUSANDS of other consumers who have had almost identical interactions with Kohl 's and their credit card. 

Kohl 's did NOT notify me that there was a payment due, past due, or balance due. Kohls did NOT notify me that a payment was late and Kohl 's did NOT notify me that they were GOING to report me to the credit bureau and Kohls did NOT notify me they DID report me to the credit bureau. 

Because of the lack of due diligence and lack of communication from Kohl 's in regards to my account and account status, because I called to correct this issue which they did not correct, plus being given improper information from their in store rep and their phone rep, I am asking that Kohl 's remove this improperly reported past due payment from my credit.

I then received a message on XXXX that on Friday my bank account would be charged approx {$800.00} for their services and was given a phone number to call the manager back. I called back and spoke to the manager who told me that I had no choice but to pay even though I had cancelled the cards and received no benefit. When I told him that I had tried cancelling at the time because I had not been told previously about having to get a XXXX XXXX and did n't want to continue if that was the process. He basically told me it was n't their fault I did n't understand the process and I had no choice because I had made a verbal contract. He said then that my mandatory payment would be sent to a collection agency and would negatively impact my credit score. I have placed fraud alerts on my accounts but do not want to be negatively affected. I believe I was misled into agreeing to pay for a service when they did not dislose the entire process to me initially. I had even been told verbatum that my credit card number would not chance which I why I did not expect a different credit card account to be created. In addition to this I learned after that legitimate companies will not contact you regarding interest reductions like this and I was involved in a scam.

68960,68960,68960,Credit card,APR or interest rate,"In XXXX of 2013 I applied for a "" Sony '' card with Capital One after watching the TV show XXXX. I was going to have a XXXX in up coming XXXX and I was going to need a new recliner to assist me in the first month or so of healing. I was grateful for the card and there was no interest for the first year. 
My first several payments were substantial, and they almost immediately raised my credit limit from {$500.00} to {$3500.00} within two or three months of my making payments well over the minimum. 
Now I live on a fixed income and this card was tempting to have because many months I have to resort to using the food bank just to have enough to eat each month, so I used the card, and I used it often. Now my balance is over {$3000.00}, but I have managed, with the help of taking in a boarder to increase my income and therefore continue to make hefty payments every month. They are XXXX, XXXX and sometimes XXXX times the minimum required. My interest, once it began to kick in is 24.9 %, yet I keep making the big payments. It is hard to get the balance paid down to a reasonable amount because of this hefty interest. I have called XXXX times in the last almost two years, trying to get them to lower the interest rate, but each time they tell me no. They tell me that the interest rate only goes down with "" special offers '', yet in the almost two years I have had this card and been paying huge payments, I have never been offered a lower interest rate. 
This company is raking in XXXX, yet they ca n't lower my interest rate from 24.9 %? I am on social security and only earn $ XXXX month. In the winter, when my heating bill rises to over {$200.00}, my average cost of living per month goes from just over {$770.00} to well over {$920.00} and that leaves very little for gas and groceries. I also receive food stamps, but for some reason, I only qualify for {$15.00} in assistance, so that is not of much help at all. 
Why wo n't this company reduce my interest rate? I have proven that I can make adequate payments, even on my limited income, yet they refuse to decrease their profit margin made on the back of some poor XXXX retired XXXX. I think it sucks ... ..but it sure seems to reflect the greed and avarice that permeates the climate of this country as of late. 
It will take me years to pay this off at this enormous interest rate.

I started using it for everyday cash purchases and using the online function to pay the bill after it would reach a point as long as I had the amount in my checking account. I stayed in touch with Capital One 's call center and had suspicion it was n't in the USA but did n't want to be labeled a XXXX. I travelled out of town to California to visit my little brother who has XXXX.

Shortly there after within a few days, I received a call from some foreign sounding man, telling me my bank had refused to give him my personal banking numbers, including routing, Social Security number, address, etc. etc. He demanded I give it to him, I refused, He got irate and wanted me to email him the info, i refused, he wanted me to XXXX call my bank, I refused and politely asked him to put it in writing on official capital one letterhead. He was n't happy and started threatening that he was going to suspend or restrict my card, to which I said something to the effect of give it your best shot and hung up.

I did receive a letter telling me they suspected fraud 10 days later and that I needed to call to resolve the matter.

Capital One took my complaint, but then denied my refund since XXXX XXXX said they refunded the baggage fee onto the other card, yet they could n't find the baggage fee on their computer system when I called to ask for a refund? They also denied it because I did n't provide a refund receipt, which I never received from XXXX XXXX. Since XXXX XXXX has that data, should n't they be required to either give it to me in the first place or supply it themselves? I also want to know how an XXXX like XXXX can say they refunded monies to a credit card that was n't even used to pay for the baggage fee originally?

I stayed on hold for over 30 minutes and never got a voice on the phone, and called back multiple times that day - never reaching anyone, only listening to music on hold. I received her letter which also went to you, of Capital One 's version of the events - It mentioned nothing of the hell I went through, how extremely unprofessional they were at all times, and how not one supervisor over there helped me for 2 months while they charged me interest on {$13000.00} and then shut down my card for late payment. It does n't mention how they broke the law by not responding to my repeated requests to refund my my interest, and to reverse this charge - the hours I spent on hold, and how badly this hurt me financially. If you want to hear about the events as they actually happened, please contact me. 

I 'm writing today because I had asked XXXX XXXX to do the following for me, in lieu of the mistakes made:1. Reverse the interest that I was charged2. Reduce my payment back to what it should be, as I could not afford to make a {$300.00} payment. 

XXXX said this would be done, and that they would not report my late payment due to their billing error to the credit bureaus. I was given permission to make an {$82.00} payment that reflected my true balance, and that the payment would be adjusted. Well, It 's been a month since I spoke to the "" Exceutive Team '' ie XXXX XXXX. Despite making the {$82.00} payment, my account has been shut down for the better part of a month, it says online that I 'm late, and that I owe a $ 160+ payment - which is not indicitive at all of my balance. And I have no idea if they reported me late to my creditors ( something they agreed not to do, as this is their error entirely ), but can only suppose that they did not honor what we agreed to in our conversation, as so many things continue to handled improperly.

Will I keep receiving new credit cards that I have to cancel? I ca n't tell based on Capital One 's current response. I have also filed a police report and filed a fraud warning with the credit bureaus. I just fear that Capital One 's response is not adequate.

I have never purchased anything from this person or website. I disputed the charge as unauthorized. Capital One replied that the merchant substantiated the transaction and they would rebill me. What was provided to substantiate the charge was a printout of the merchant 's website ( which I did not recognize ) and a copy of the charge billed to the wrong expiration date, wrong cvv code, and wrong address. The only accurate piece of information was my card number, which has n't changed since I received the yard many years ago. 

I did research and noticed that this charge was also made by the merchant exactly one year ago. I did n't recognize it then either and the records show I disputed it and it was removed from my bill. 

I responded to Capital One 's rebill by letter indicating that the unauthorized charge was still disputed, that I never made this purchase, never used any product or service from this merchant, and to advise the merchant to stop billing me. I attached documentation of the previous dispute from a year ago. 

Capital One today sent me a letter saying "" your request lacks all of the previously requested information to validate your dispute ''. Please see the attached letter Capital One is referring to. I provided all of the information possible. It is not my responsibility to contact the merchant to beg for a credit for something I never purchased.

74657,74657,74657,Credit card,Billing disputes,"Good afternoon, I am submitting a complaint on the manner that Capital One managed a charge I dispute on my Credit Card Account. Following is a detail account of the events that transpired : On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I went on-line to find car rental for XXXX during XX/XX/XXXX. I used the XXXX search engine to review the different alternatives and choose XXXX of them. I booked the reservation with XXXX. The reservation total cost was {$370.00}. I prepaid the reservation in full using my XXXX XXXX. 
I received an e-mail confirming the reservation and the rental agreement. The reservation included unlimited mileage, taxes, airport fees, liability and fire insurance. The agreement stated in the terms and condition "" Upfront Pricing, and No Hidden Fees ''. 

Attached for your reference are the following documents : Confirmation and agreement of the reservation Full payment of the reservation with my XXXX XXXX. 

During XXXX 2015, I traveled to XXXX and used the reservation as previously agreed. On XXXX/XXXX/2015, I arrived at the XXXX rental desk to pick up the car. During this process, I gave my Capital One credit card as insurance for any accidental damages. I only signed a document stating that I was retrieving the vehicle in full working condition with no damages. I did not sign for or authorized any additional charges. 

I returned the on XX/XX/XXXX, as previously agreed upon. The car was returned in perfect condition with no damages. On XX/XX/XXXX, I notice that XXXX charged me an additional {$690.00}. I contacted XXXX to inquire about these charges and they told me that they were "" additional fees '' part of the rental agreement. I refused the charges, on the grounds that they were not previously disclosed or agreed by me. I had no luck with them, so I initiated the dispute with Capital One to eliminate these charges. 

I contacted Capital One to dispute these charges on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I provided a full written explanation and copies of the supporting evidence. As part of the investigation process, Capital One received an itemized bill from XXXX detailing the additional charges of {$690.00}. Capital One shared this bill with me. Capital One told me that this bill "" demonstrates '' that the charges are valid and the dispute would be closed in the favor of the Merchant. I immediately contacted them to state that the bill is fraudulent. The bill was not signed or approved by me. Furthermore, the bill was created and produced after the rental agreement was over. None of the additional fees in this new bill proceed either because they were fully prepaid by the reservation or they were not part of the term s and conditions of the original agreement. 

I contacted Capital One in numerous occasions though the phone, fax and e-mail to explain that the addional charges were never authorized by me, are not part of the terms and conditions of the original agreement and therefore do not proceed. Capital One did not gave credit to any of my explanations or supporting document. They only gave credit, to a bill which was fraudulently created after the rental agreement was over. Capital One closed my dispute in favor of the customer on XXXX XXXX, 2015.

After about a month, all the companies did what they promised and all charges were refunded. I then felt secure and went on about my life thinking everything was okay. Some time passed maybe another two weeks and Capital One sent me a notification that they were not recognizing my fraud claim and that it was not considered fraud. I immediately called them to figure out what was going on. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and they still will not take these fraudulent charges off my account. I have spoken to XXXX XXXX. ( they will not give me her last name ) in the fraud department what seems like hundreds of times, talked to her manager, and anyone else who will speak to me in the fraud department and get no where. They say it is my job to prove that it was not me who made the charges, which I have done to the best of my ability. I have done everything they have asked of me including filing a police report with the XXXX XXXX Police Department. They still are charging me! I have had arguments and explained to Capital One that they told me I am not liable and even took it off my account for about a month just to be put back on. They are basically calling me a liar and instead of being innocent until I am guilty they are saying I am guilty until I can figure out to prove my innocent which I feel like I have. I am not a lawyer and do not really no where to go from hear. I even told them that both other credit card companies recognized them as fraud ( thanks and great customer service from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) but Capital One says they do not care and that their fraud requirements are different. 

I am just requesting what Capital One told me when I signed up with them, that I would not be held liable for fraudulent charges and to take off the fraudulent charges. I have all detailed information to move forward with a resolution or if it is not resolved a lawsuit.

To fast forward a bit, the bank says they will report non-payments to the Credit Bureau that I did not pay my loan and am 2 months late. Are you kidding? I have n't been late or missed in 10 years on that loan!!!! 
I called the corporate offices of this bank and was given no consideration for loyalty or good payment history. They were rude and told me I should have come in a month earlier. Yet, I did come in before the maturity date, that was the defining time. Now I find out that the time difference was only for their convenience, to collect some data that I know you can get in 1 or 2 days. And nothing has to do with me as a good customer. 
I have good credit and have no bad things on my credit. Now they are claiming they are going to report me as late on my loan and I have never missed a payment through the life of the loan. In addition I paid while in the refinance process. And have proof of this. This whole handling of this event is so unfair and absurd! Everyone I tell this to can not believe it. 
What can I do to not let this happen to my good credit that I 've worked so hard for? Please let me know how to handle this. 
PS i was misled and taken advantage of by the bank officer which is another story on its own.

75349,75349,75349,Credit card,Transaction issue,"First, I want to thank CapitalOne for resolving the previous issue with the credit line semi-efficiently, it 's just unfortunate do n't provide for such resolutions without involving the CFPB ( ca n't just email CapOne ) ... Unfortunately now have another issue but this time a slightly bigger issue. We tried to file a dispute online and the system was down, it was down for a week or so as we continued to try to no avail. We called and after several questions, were told to call back in a couple hours because the system was down ( this compared to, 'can we call you back once our systems are back up and running? ). I think companies are confused in thinking that consumers wake up seeking things to do so they are happy to spend half a day trying to resolve something that should take a simple email. I deal with things at odd hours and during those hours, really do n't care to discuss the issues on the phone ... 

So now via this complaint, CapOne needs to process the dispute we have been trying to submit. It 's for the purchase XXXX XXXX to XXXX for {$120.00}. Yes, we tried resolving this through XXXX and also through XXXX. Please also understand that we use our credit card with XXXX versus simply drafting from our account precisely for this protection that it affords ( we do n't need to buy using credit ). For the timeline and why taken so long which is part of the issue. Bought an item that shipped from XXXX so took a month to get to us so that takes us to midXXXX. Immediately installed it so within 24 hours of receiving it notified the seller that there appeared to be a problem ( it was n't completely dead, just seemingly not working right ). After that communication started I think in hindsight the seller began intentionally delaying the communications. Most every communication I had to follow back up and were given excuses like he was in the hospital, he had to wait several days for the XXXX factory to response, then XXXX XXXX XXXX ... which means another month ticked by and in the end, which by this time the unit completely failed, but the seller stated he did n't believe there was a problem and offered me {$20.00} ( {$20.00} for a {$130.00} unit that at that point was dead, obviously not a equitable resolution ). So at that point contacted XXXX who essentially said too much time had gone by even though they could clearly see the communications I detailed above ( the communications were a part of their messaging system ). So then contacted XXXX and also no resolution. All of that took a few weeks and then the issues trying to get this submitted with CapOne and here we are. Here I am also with a new heater I purchased which CapOne can find that charge a few weeks ago ( another XXXX for around {$140.00} ). 

So that is basically all of the info but if CapOne needs more, please email me as they did with the other issue. Of course they did n't respond after I responded and continued to try to call but clearly they have the ability to email which to me is more efficient.

78039,78039,78039,Credit card,APR or interest rate,"I am writing to file a complaint about Capital One. It is regarding my account numbers ending in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
I have been an account holder of theirs since 2000. I have never paid any of the accounts late. Recently, I noticed that they increased my rate on my account ending in # XXXX to 23.15 %. They have also increased the rate on my account ending in # XXXX to 18.15 %. Both of these accounts have had balances, and they have been steadily increasing the rates on these accounts. I believe they have been doing this in a predatory manner, primarily because the accounts have balances. In comparison, my account ending in # XXXX is not in use, although it is open, and my interest rate is 10.17 %. It is also important to note that my credit bureau is in good standing, and all of my other credit cards have rates of less than 15 %. When I called Capital One to complain, I spoke with a rep named XXXX. She gave a fairly lousy excuse for the rate increase, stating prime had gone up. But she offered to lower the rate to 20.15 % for 7 months. I is also important to note that the XXXX credit cards with balances have lower cash advance rates compared to purchase rates, which makes absolutely no sense ; cash advances are a higher risk than purchases due to the nature of the transaction. Simply put, I believe they are increasing the purchase rate on my credit cards because of running balances that are not always paid in full each month. In other words, they are preying on my ability on whether I can pay the accounts off.

It even appeared and still does, that my card had been compromised by fraudulent charges. There was nothing to explain these high payments due when payments and calls were being made to the company timely consistently. In addition, about the second time I called about this CP practice, it said that a payment had been returned in XX/XX/XXXX for NFS, and not resolved which would not be the case when payments are made each month on line or called-in by phone. CP continued to try and attempt saying two months of payments were not made on XXXX of the cards. Payments were made on-line timely and directly from my automatic payment from my bank. I believe the alleged two months of "" missed-payments '' is in retaliation for my first showing to CP its fraudulent practice ongoing since then.

XXXX of them was to a XXXX Rewards card. Initially, I asked Capital One to honor the terms listed on its website for a new XXXX Rewards card. It refused to do so.

Instead, a higher APR, no cash bonus, and who knows what else would be different on my new card that was called by the same name as the XXXX described on Capital One 's website.

Then it refused to close my current, unwanted credit card. It demanded that I hang on the phone while it read me a bunch of garbage I had no interest in, given that I wanted no further dealings with it, all so that Capital One could evade responsibility for its unethical if not illegal activity. They will try to continue to treat their customers poorly if they can get away with it.

Capital One continues, unabated, in its questionable practices. Finally, when it became clear that I did not want to have any of this untrustworthy bank 's products, in light of its multi-year abuse and habitual efforts at bait and switch routines, it actually threatened me through the following. First, as mentioned, it claimed that it would not close the account as I directed it to do. Second, the representative demanded that I listen to her as an illegal condition of her closing the account. Finally, I think she said something to the effect as I was hanging up, that they would never consider an application from me again, or some other punitive threat all for the purpose of intimidating and manipulating me into accepting their illegal, abusive terms. Why is Capital One allowed to continue to abuse the public and its customers? I think they are based in XXXX. Does n't that State have an office of Financial Services regulation? XXXX does ; what 's wrong with XXXX that it lags behind other large states that have had to deal with abusive banks? This is clearly a case analogous to the illicit activity of XXXX XXXX.

Capital one had no good reason for initially putting the account into the status, and has refused to remove it. When I initially called the fraud department to discuss the matter on XXXX/XXXX/2016, the fraud specialist wanted to verify some balance transfers that I requested. We were able to verify that no problem. 

However, that is when the problem started. They wanted to verify two payments I had made from XXXX separate checking accounts on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. We had to conference call each credit union to verify that the funds have cleared. For the payment on XX/XX/XXXX, we were able to do that without a problem. Unfortunately, the credit union that I made the payment from on XX/XX/XXXX does not verify information over the phone for account security. They suggested that capital one fax in a request for information and they would respond by fax. Capital One indicated this was not acceptable. Instead, the fraud agent asked me to send in a copy of a recent statement from the checking account. I provided that information to capital one, and called back a few days later. They said that the information was insufficient to remove the restriction and I had to provide transaction details showing that the payment cleared from the checking account. I did that, and capital one said that was not sufficient to remove the restriction. I also provided a letter from the bank indicating that I owned the checking account in question ( the letter had my name, my address, and the checking account number and was signed by a bank officer ). That was also not sufficient to remove the restriction. 

Capital One 's payment verification system is incredibly stupid. Their employees continuously blame me because the credit union wo n't give out information over the phone. At no time prior to the payment being made did Capital One indicate that this type of verification would be needed to accept an ach payment from a checking account. Moreover, they are unwilling to return the payment and let me replace the payment from a different bank that they can verify. In fact, I sent in bill payments while the account has been frozen with the hope that would be sufficient for Capital One. It was not, and there is now a large credit balance on the account. I have never had a payment returned, or been late with a payment on this account. Capital One had no good reason to initially put the account under review. They said something about my protection, which is a complete lie. Mind you, the payment in question was made about 3 weeks ago.

I had previously sent a wire to the same company XX/XX/XXXX. This time however, the wire was never sent and when I contacted the bank they indicated that my accounts were frozen. Over the next few days I placed numerous calls to Capital One and was directed to either the security dept of XXXX, both of whom have hold times of over an hour. I spent a total of approx 6 hours on hold over a 2 day period only to learn that my accounts were being closed because the wire I requested was being sent to a company which deals in XXXX, a virtual currency. This prohibition is not in their terms & conditions nor in any other pulished material provided by the bank. Apparently Capital One bank considers bitcoin a threat to it 's business model and sees fit to keep people from spending their own money how they see fit. I was annoyed, but it is what it is. I requested that Capital One please transfer the balance in my accounts to my linked account at XXXX XXXX. They said it may take a couple days, but that they would do so. Additionally, they said that I would receive and email detailing why my accounts were closed. That conversation occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. I have tried to follow up many times but the bank has actively avoided speaking to me about the issue. I have been disconnected multiple times while holding for the dept who would be able to provide answers. If it occured once or twice, I would accept that it was just a disconnect ... but when it occurs 5 times and ONLY when I am holding for the XXXX XXXX Dept., then the chances of it being random are astronomically low. They are currently holding approx {$10000.00} and have given no reason for the siezure nor any indication that they will ever return the money. There has been no levy, garnishment, tax siezure or anything of the sort. I have not committed fraud nor am I under investigation for anything ( though I guess if I were, I would n't know about it, would I? ) As far as I know, they can not sieze depositor funds at will with no reason provided.

81270,81270,81270,Credit card,Delinquent account,"Firstly, I would like to point out that I am being penalized unfairly by a financial institution whose actions described herein appear to be at best arbitrary and at worst discriminatory. I have a perfect record of one time payments with the exception of a department store card issued by capital one. I own my home and have excellent credit. I missed a 30-day deadline for one of my credit cards during XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. All other bills were paid timely. I was out of the country and I made sure to pay my bills before I left however, this particular payment was an oversight. I had no idea that I was late with a payment, if I had, I would have immediately paid this bill over the phone. Further, I ensured that I had international phone service abroad for any emergencies that may come up while I was away. I never revived a call or voicemail indicating that my payment was late. Missing this payment had nothing to do with my creditworthiness as far as being able and willing to meet my financial obligations. When I returned to the country and realized that I had missed a payment, I immediately brought my account current. I submitted a request to the company to remove the flag in order to restore my standing and I explained that this was a one time error that would not repeat itself. They denied my request and did not give a reason as to why. I believe that this not only is a poor business practice, but it also penalizes me unfairly whereby others have been granted this request. I understand this company has a history of appearing to make credit decisions based on certain demographic information. I 'm XXXX and XXXX. That is the only notable difference between me and another individual who was granted this request. Although this is not a credit decision, per se, the denial of good faith action from a financial institution will negatively impact my credit for years to come. I came to my creditor in good faith to advise that this was a one-time error that was exacerbated by me being out of the country and unawares of my late status. For instance, I received no call or voicemail once my payment was past due, at a minimum I expect the bank to exercise certain actions such as a phone call when a payment has been missed. I ask that the CFPB intervene on my behalf and request that the credit card company remove the 30 day late flag from my credit report, and restore my perfect repayment history. Further, I would like to ask the financial institution to provide an explanation around the decision to deny a goodwill gesture or accept certain other requests.

It was n't until months later when I noticed the various, suspicious product names on the XXXX statements that seemed to rotate each month. These product names were XXXX ', XXXX ', XXXX , XXXX '. I never ordered additional products other than the XXXX trial offers that totaled less than {$10.00}. The first person at Capital One VISA customer service I spoke to in attempting to rectify the problem was employee # XXXX. She listened politely to my dilema and explained that Capital One would send a dispute letter to the merchant while temporarily reversing all the charges. If the merchant did not respond, the credits would hold and If Capital One VISA believed these charges to be fraudulent, all charges would remain dismissed as well. The maximum credit period was normally 90-120 days but could cover the entire 10 month period if fraud was evident. At that moment, it felt great that justice would be done in hopes that potentially thousands of other trusting consumers would not be duped as I was. My optimism was short lived as I received a letter XXXX/XXXX/16 from Capital One stating they were reapplying all the charges and if I still wanted to dispute these charges, I was to contact the merchant directly. I then contacted XXXX XXXX, also doing business as XXXX ' and XXXX XXXX ', etc. and spoke to XXXX. 
She explained they would only give me a 30 day credit until I told her I would file a complaint with Consumer Protection. She placed me on hold then returned to offer a 90 day credit. When I asked her why the change, she replied it was due to my threat to report the company to the Consumer Protection Agency.

Although I was purchasing a new hybrid car at {$19000.00} in order to keep my costs and expenses down, I wound up with a payment of {$530.00} per month. as if I was purchasing a XXXX or XXXX or some other high end car. After paying on it first for a couple of years without missing or being more than 30 days late on a payment, then XXXX, 4 years without missing or being more than 30 days late on a payment, each time asking Capital One to PLEASE reduce my interest as it was a struggle to make the payments, they turned me down each time. Even though I was not more than 30 days late during that time, there was no grace period I learned in this loan so Capital One was making a good amount of money also on late fees I had to pay at {$35.00} per month if my payment did not get to them on the XXXX due date. I was often XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX or more days late so I paid that late fee often due to when XXXX 's fell, or if I were pressed to pay a utility bill to keep service from being disconnected and buy food too which left insufficient money to pay the car note. I have now been paying on this car more than 5 years, however, in the past year and actually also at the end of the 4th year, I have been more than 30 days late and missed payments which never would have happened if I had been charged a more fair high interest rate because the car would have been paid for last year or the year before. During the 6 years of this car note, I have about 9 months remaining, I have developed XXXX XXXX, had a XXXX, been terminated from my job at XXXX XXXX XXXX and live only on social security. Consequently my income has dropped dramatically. I am 3 months behind with my car note. This car is less than a year from being paid for. It 's not fair I am in threat of losing this car at this point when one considers how much money I have paid Capital One for this {$19000.00} car at the rate of {$530.00} per month for more than 60 months plus late fees - over {$35000.00}! An attorney told me my income is insufficient to file chapter XXXX bankruptcy to keep the car and if I file chapter XXXX, I 'll lose the car anyway. Capital One has statement on the monthly statement that My last payment is due XXXX/XXXX/2016, the original last payment date, and the balance will be due immediately in full. I wo n't have it or I would n't be behind now. Capital One is just using this hard nose way to get all the money they loaned, 16 % interest, all the late fees which total nearly double to cost of the car and still they 'll steal the car from me on or about XXXX/XXXX/2016.

I called Capital One and the agent explained that even though I received the credit of {$25.00} and paid {$50.00} ( a total of {$75.00} credit on a {$65.00} bill ) I still needed to pay the full {$65.00} that was due at the time, so essentially I was being reported late for {$15.00} because the rep at Capital One did not know her job and told me I was paid in full with her {$25.00} credit and my {$50.00} payment. The rep that I was speaking with ( who said he was a supervisor ) stated he will remove the 60 day late payment stemming from the XXXX miscommunication but will not do anything about the 30 day late from XXXX, I told him that was fair and went on my way, this was XXXX XXXX. 

I called on XXXX XXXX to make sure all was going according to plan and sure enough the rep I spoke with this time said nothing is being done and I was advised wrong but they will review the recording and if that is what I was told, they will honor it ( this rep was a supervisor ) I was told she will review this and be in close contact with me.

She also claimed that a new card for each account would be sent to me. 

After a week elapsed, there was no credit card. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. I reached out to capital one and was told that card was sent and maybe it is taking a little while to reach me. After another week, I called to have the cards that were sent as replacements canceled and to send another set of replacements. 

( While experiencing this issue with not receiving cards, my account was not credited during the entire month of XXXX ). 

XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to speak with XXXX again and was told that the investigation was still be processed and that I would hear back in 2 weeks. 

In on XX/XX/XXXX, I called back to have checked the status of my accounts and inquire about the location of my cards. When I was routed to customer service the agent asked me to verify my mailing address, which I provided every time I called in, and I advised my cards has been sent to the incorrect mailing address twice. However, since my cards were being investigated, he was unable to process the replacement and I would have to speak with my account manager, XXXX. After being told this, I asked to speak with here to which I was advised she was unavoidable and would give me a callback. 

The rest od the month of XXXX consisted of me calling Captial one to figure out what was going on with my account a trying to get in contact with my account manager. All the while, capital one is charging interest and late fees. 

I spent XX/XX/2016 calling into capital one and being transferred to different departments, so much so, I was unable to keep a record of the calls and dates. The frustration and time spent has been colossal.

Currently, this payment cut-off deadline, at XXXX XXXX is four hours before XXXX on the due-date.

85984,85984,85984,Credit card,Closing/Cancelling account,"I 'm submitting another CFPB Complaint against Capital One Bank ( Credit Cards Division, AKA : Firm ) for a spectrum of reasons which I will detail herein my complaint however, in general after the firm had granted/approved a second credit account post final determination of the below referenced complaint ( XXXX ), the firm retaliated against me for filling a Government Complaint with CFPB and closed this second credit account. Furthermore, in my belief, the firm refused to reopen my original account via their appeal process because I decided to submit the original CFPB Complaint when the firm had not complied with their turn around time frames to communicate with me regarding the appeal status ; the oversight/submitting manager even asked me not to submit the CFPB Complaint yet. 

This new complaint is because of Capital One Bank ( 'Firm ' ) being deceptive, abusive, retaliatory, and financially harmful to me from XXXX of 2016 to current, XXXX of 2016. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX XXXX Capital One Bank to apply for an unsecured credit card with "" Good Odds '' of approval. XXXX 2016, a multitude of Capital One firm agents advised me that my original/secured credit card account was closed due to returned payments and secured credit card accounts can never be reopened, no matter if a bank error was the closure cause ; therefore regardless of my appeal outcome, I was still eligible to apply for another Capital One Credit Card account. With the advice and permission of firm agents, as well as, direct solicitation from firm itself to apply for a new credit card account ; I did so on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and was immediately approved for a XXXX XXXX, unsecured revolving credit card account ( Second Capital One Account/Credit Card ). 

Upon approval, the firm emailed me confirmations and automatically linked the new account to my pre-existing online profile which includes to this day, the first closed credit card. Approximately XXXX5 days later, I received my XXXX credit card in the mail ; then activating the card with my name associated with it. Since activation of the card and account, I 've made many purchases and have since submitted XXXX ACH Payments that were sent via my bank, XXXX XXXX and have cleared. On XXXX 2016, the firm without notice, decided to close my newly opened credit account. The reason that I was given was because of recent returned payments, which can only be true for the prior account that was closed and not of this second account. 

This is unfair, deceptive and abusive practices by advising & direct soliciting me that I am eligible to apply for credit card products. Once I do apply for a credit card product, the firm approves the application, sends me the new account cards, allows and consents to activation of the new credit card account, as well as debit transactions and accepts my successful payments. After all of this, the firm then closes this newly approved credit card account without notice to me until I attempted to use the credit card at a grocery store and it was decline per a restriction to close the account. The first case and closure on XXXX XXXX, 2016 has caused very negative impacts to my Credit reports ( CBR 's ) and their credit scores per the account closure and then now there 's another hard inquiry on my CBR and there will be another credit card closure per credit grantor/lender. This looks very negative to other creditors that will review my CBRs and will impact me for years to come. I 've also incurred an annual fee of {$39.00} on the newly approved/activated credit card.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Capital One adjusted my account by adding {$250.00} and {$500.00} to my balance. As mentioned above, I neutralized the {$250.00} double credit.

A few days later, I received the exact same letter from Capital One. This is NOT CORRECT. Nowhere on any statement or account activity document does a {$500.00} credit from Nortstroms show up. I initiated numerous calls to the Customer Fraud Protection unit at XXXX, the number on the letter, These calls were an exercise in major frustration mainly because it was so difficult to understand the so-called customer service representatives because of the lack of their English language skills ( and yes, I did press the correct selection for English ).

The problem I am encountering is actually submitting the credit dispute with Capital One, because they do n't have my information and when I call the current servicer/owner of the XXXX portfolio, XXXX, they tell me they can not help me because the account was transferred to them in a "" closed '' status and because capital one is the one reporting me I have to dispute it with them. They advised me that Capital One did n't send all the information they should have when they obtained the portfolio. They can give me general information, but not any information for me I need. I asked them if they could send me my statements from when Capital One serviced the account because when the card was opened I got statements from capital one electronically which was just an email from them saying, '' hey just log in online. '' Which helps me zero. All of those emails I got wont help because I cant access the links included in them because again the portfolio was sold. 
Honestly this is not fair, because my credit is being impacted and I am trying to prepare to purchase a home. 
I am trying to dispute XXXX, XXXX and XXXX reporting from Capital One for this card. They reported to the bureaus that I was late 30 days for XXXX, and 60 days past due for XXXX and XXXX. This was all caused because of an annual fee. This annual fee of roughly around {$50.00} reopened the XXXX capital one account AFTER it was supposed to closed. 
This was a system error that Capital One eventually took ownership of and they credited back the charge and closed the account. This happened in XXXX but the reporting to the bureaus remained. Which is XXXX item I wanted to dispute. 
I also wanted to dispute the account reporting in XXXX of XXXX. Which on my report shows that it was 90 days delinquent. Again this was NOT correct and is relevant to the above XXXX to XXXX dispute because Capital One sold and transferred the account in XXXX to a collection agency. Whom I paid in full. 
The problem with that is that i have confirmation emails of making payments in XXXX, through XXXX. So how could I be 90 days past due? Why was I ever transferred to a collection agency in XXXX after making monthly payments each month? 
Thankfully I signed up for automatic emails during this time confirming my payments each month but the sheer lack of process from both XXXX and Capital One to get this process finished has honestly been nothing but frustrating. RESPA prevents this from happening in mortgage servicing, but apparently if a credit cards are purchased between banks or financial institutions it does n't matter how the consumer is treated.

I continued to reach out to Capital One and reached out directly to the executive office in the XX/XX/2016, yet again and continued to correspond throughout this year. After sending a massive package of documentation via fax and physical mail to go over and honor the dispute that I was explained would be taken care of, the representative in charge, never followed through. I called twice per week, every week this year alone, not counting the previous times. As I continued to send the documentation in, specifically for charges that were paid by other means, the representative continued to send me emails that he was working on the issue. 

The issue continued throughout the year until I received an email that the XXXX credit cards that were unsecured, would be open and that I would have a choice of keeping my secured account reopened or close it and I would be refunded the secured amount THAT I INVESTED IN, over {$1200.00} dollars. I chose to keep the accounts open and I have n't heard back from Capital One since the XX/XX/2016.

Kohl 's is currently working on the fraud case however I feel the practice of Kohl 's not deactivating the old card when a new XXXX is sent sets up the consumer for fraud.

I had them close every thing and they are supposed to send a new card. They also said they would not report anything to the credit bureau until the investigation was complete which could take up to 60 days.

90000,90000,90000,Mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker","I underwent a refinance with CapitalOne last XXXX. During this process my home came in at a value less than expected, and I indicated that the loan offer was thus not very attractive to me. The loan officer then told me he would work on it, and I was presented with a final calculation of escrow plus payment that came to {$990.00}, less than what I was currently paying. However, he did not inform me at the time that in order to reach that calculation my escrow was only partially funded, leaving me with a negative balance that I had to make up. My mortgage payment just jumped to {$1100.00}, which exceeds my previous payment. Given that a loan officer would know that partial funding of an escrow would result in this jump, and given that I was never informed that this jump would take place ( my taxes and insurance would likely remain roughly the same, so these costs could easily be anticipated ), I believe the loan was crafted to present an artificially low payment to entice me to take the offer. It did beat other offers, and I selected this packaged based on this monthly payment. I believe that by not informing me of what would happen, it created this low payment, securing my contract, and left me as the consumer to pay a higher cost later to CaptialOne 's benefit. This was a very unethical business practice, for the loan officer did not tell me this would happen, nor was I informed at signing what would occur. I was just told "" this is your payment.

I told them I would be a little short at closing and they told me too bad and continued the fcl. I had to file bk to stay in the house and get another place to live. I did this, they got the house in fcl. After filing bk they sent me invoices for two years for the full amount and at the bottom it said "" this is not an invoice ''. So I have asked them to change or delte the account because of their FDCPA violations, their claims they were helping people during that time and they would not even short sale the account for less then XXXX, because that even after I brought the account current they refused to change it from a charge off so I could refi at a lower rate and pay them off. Capital One went out of their way to make sure I was fcl on and evicted even when they had several chances to change the rating and allow me to refi. I have disputed this with the credit reporting agencies on 6 sep occasions and asked for documents and for them to report the first date of delq and they just respond saying "" investigation complete '' without sending me a thing. I dont think a person looks at the disputes I think, just like my fcl, it is all automated. I have spoken with one attorney, not retained, and he wants me to just sue them but I feel at the end of the day despite the financial crisis, despite that homes of this value would not sell I was responsible. With that said I am not responsible for robo fcl 's or robo responses to my disputes. If the will delete the account I will go about my business if they wont I will take this to court for all it is worth. The recording of the lady telling me "" I better pay up or I will be out in the street '' should be worth something in front of a Jury.

91665,91665,91665,Bank account or service,"Account opening, closing, or management","This letter is to follow up on our recent contact with you earlier this month. As we explained, we have been the victims of identity theft. It recently came to our attention that our names, home and business addresses, dates of birth and social security numbers have been used to open savings and checking accounts and to obtain pre-paid debit cards. 

Specifically, in 2016 our personal information was used to open a checking account at Capital One 360. Of note, this occurred without Capital One performing a credit check with any of the XXXX credit reporting agencies, and fraudulent email addresses and phone numbers were provided and not checked for validity. We believe these are egregious practices. We have spoken with Capital One, who has reportedly closed the account. 

We are informing you of this so that any further activity using our names and numbers without our knowledge or consent should be considered part of that identity breach. Further, we have requested that our financial institutions inform us of any activity using our names and other identifying information prior to completing any fund transfers, opening new accounts or any other financial activities. 

We are reaching out to you with this letter on advice of our legal counsel and the Oregon Attorney General 's office, and as one of several law enforcement-recommended actions. We have already notified the XXXX credit reporting agencies and our other financial institutions. We have filed official reports with our local law enforcement agencies and the Federal Trade Commission. 

Our goal is to be proactive in protecting ourselves, as well as to assist our financial institutions, law enforcement and legislators to address an apparent gap in this vulnerable system that needs immediate repair. We would like you to work with us to help stop this fraudulent activity. For instance, we believe that all banking institutions should be required to perform and document a formal credit check, as a matter of legal record, in order to open a new account of any kind and to double check the validity of email and phone information provided. 

The Oregon Attorney General 's office has advised us to be in constant contact with our financial institutions as we do our part to monitor this situation closely. Needless to say, the more cooperation there is between stakeholders, the more likely criminal behavior such as this can be dealt with effectively toward a just resolution. We have requested that our accounts have a notation documenting this identity breach. We have changed our passwords, added an additional security "" code word '' and initiated Voice Print identification to our accounts. 

Any further suggestions for additional actions we can take toward protecting ourselves would be appreciated.

Today I had my husband call Capital One to find out why his Capital One account would have money applied accurately and timely and mine was not. He spoke with a "" Supervisor XXXX '' who 's Agent ID was identified as XXXX. She indicated that she did not know why, but that Capital One 's policy is that they can hold money for four ( 4 ) days. XXXX could not identify what indicators would trigger this business practice. XXXX also indicated that Capital One has reported to the Credit Bureaus that my current balance is {$180.00}.

My account has never been paid late, considered a slow pay account or otherwise given any trigger that I am not an honest, credit worthy, credit responsible customer. XXXX 's response was she was following Capital One policy ; or politely saying she did n't care nor does Capital One! 

My concerns are, Capital One holding funds, then charging interest though the statement balance was paid in full, is not only unfair but deceptive. Capital One reporting to the credit bureaus that payments were made in the amount of {$3800.00} but an available credit of {$51.00} could impact my debt to income ratio and lead to potential lenders in their underwriting processing questioning my credit worthiness. This is not only deceptive but unfair. Is this because I am female and do not make the income of my spouse or my male counterparts at Capital One? Do they enforce these same practices with their own employees or executives? They did not with my husband! Last, when asked to speak to XXXX 's supervisor or to someone on Capital One 's Corporate Escalation Team, she refused.

Within the last couple years, I had to close the account ( get a new account number ) once when my son lost his card and then again when Capital One changed to chip cards. Changing account numbers is a real hassle for the consumer who has payments tied to the card. 

Several times the fraud department has declined transactions, even though they were n't fraudulent. Typically, I could respond to a text or email and retry the transaction, but this is n't very convenient if others are waiting in line behind you at a store ( especially at a grocery store checkout, for example ). 

Yesterday was the last straw with me. I received a call from the fraud department regarding some small charges, none of which were fraudulent. In fact, one of the charges they asked me about was a regular monthly charge that has appeared on my account for over a year. Apparently, their computer program "" suspected '' that there was a fraud problem, and they insisted on closing the account. I spoke with a supervisor in the fraud department and told her that I did n't want my account number changed yet again, especially since it was a chip card ( supposedly more secure ) and there were no fraudulent charges. She just gave me the spiel about the computer suspecting something and insisted on closing the account. I asked to speak with her boss, and she told me she does n't report to anyone, which I find very hard to believe. So I told her I 'm done with Capital One. Apparently, they do n't care about losing business.

I understood when I got the card that I would have 0 % interest until XX/XX/2016, after that I would start paying interest on any balance after that time. Because of this I began pursuing other methods of paying my balance in a more manageable fashion than dealing with the oncoming high interest rates of this card. I then received an offer from Capital One regarding balance transfers. I called to ask questions about the offer and to see if it would affect my current balance. The person I talked to said the offer would n't affect my current balance, but that was irrelevant because I would never have to pay any interest on my balance anyway. This was news to me so I had him further clarify. He then told me that only purchases after XXXX XXXX would incur interest, and that any regular purchases I made before that date would not ever incur interest. I then stopped perusing other methods of paying off the balance, and made other purchases on the card. 

However, after XXXX XXXX I saw I had a substantial interest charge on my account. I called Capitol One to dispute it because I had n't made purchases on the card from XXXX XXXX onward. The person said that it was the interest on my entire balance. I explained what had been told to me during my last call and she thought I simply did n't understand what my terms were, but I made it very clear that I did understand how my card worked. I said that if they were to go back and listen to the conversation I had with the representative, they would clearly hear him explain that I would not be paying interest on regular purchases before XXXX XXXX. She said there was nothing she could do, so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager said that he would waive that interest change, then the call dropped. When I called back they said I would n't be able to speak to that manager again, but they could get another manager for me. When the new manager got on the phone she also claimed that I simply misunderstood how credit cards worked and tried to explain it. Again, I had to make it clear that I did in fact understand how it all works and that before talking to the person in my original phone call, I thought that was how my card worked. It was only after I was clearly told by this representative of Capital One, did I understand it differently. I took the representative 's word because I should be able to assume that a representative of Capitol One would have a better understanding of how my credit card works that I do. If I was in fact mislead by your company, I, the victim, should not be the one responsible for that mistake. She said she understood I had been misinformed by the company, but that the only thing she could do at this point would be to take off the single interest charge, but it had already been done. She said there was no way to remove or prevent future interest charges, even if I had been mislead. I asked for the recording of the original conversation and she said they do not give the recordings to the customers. I then asked if could at least have a lower interest rate, and she said no. 

Because a representative of Capital One grossly mislead me, my original plans to pay off the balance have fallen though, I made purchases I would have never made had I still had my original understanding of my terms, I have to make much higher payments than expected, I might not even be able to make a dent on my balance because of interest charges I am now stuck with, and my plans to return to school in the fall could also fall through.

Then came the CREDIT CARD bill from XXXX which was a month behind from the accounts and we noticed right away over {$600.00} worth of issues and let XXXX know. We told XXXX and they were suppose to look into it and get back to us. Around XXXX 2012. We had a lot of business stuff going on and other things and cause of all the issues I decided to go the SECURED route way of getting XXXX small CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARDS with {$600.00} deposit on an {$800.00} card, {$400.00} deposit on a {$600.00} card, {$200.00} deposit on a {$200.00} card and {$400.00} deposit on a {$600.00} card. {$1600.00} deposit and {$600.00} line credit from CAPITAL ONE. And we had a XXXX card {$200.00} deposit on {$300.00} credit, {$100.00} credit line from XXXX. With all the issues we were having we felt this would he a safer bet, XXXX secured cards between XXXX of us, small incriments with deposits made by us. Right from the get go there were major issues with CAPITAL ONE. Not only will me phone records show, but XXXX was witnesses on many many occassions., but anytime I made a CAPITAL ONE SECURED CARD payment it was senf from a CAPITAL ONE BANK account. Evertytime I made a payment I did it over the phone. And everytime ( 25 times or more ), CAPITAL ONE SECURED CARD confirmed the payment went through card was ready to use. In every instance, when trying to use the CAPITAL ONE card, it would not work, funds were not there, to pay bills, groceries or gas, or going out to eat and finding out your money not there. I would have to call CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD back, they would have call CAPITAL ONE BANK, so it was not only the one phone call to make my payment, but I would have to call up to three times just cause payment oddly kept falling off the card even though they said it was there. It would disappear causing extreme situations and the time consumption was ridiculous. As well, in XXXX 2012 robbery I be discussing, someone stole XXXX of our XXXX cards and tried to use it, the merchant was the one to notify us of this. And, this happened three times while we had these cards. As well, we received a CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD for a XXXX attached to my account that we never authorized. We not only never missed a payment, in fact we paid full balance each time. We ended up speaking to someone in FRAUD over the weird card showing up and the fact people were using our cards without permission and we decided to close all CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT DOWN. The headaches alone of spending 5 to 10 hours a week dealing with calling over the deposit disappearing and us being out places looking like idiots was enough in itself to close cards. At the time WE HAD NO MONEY OWED ON CARD, we put {$1400.00} secured down on {$1800.00} credit. When cards were closed we were owed {$1200.00}. Instead CAPITAL ONE put all XXXX cards in collections, and here is how you can immediatly identfy their error. They reported each card at the exact dollar amount the card had value. So if the card was {$800.00} card, {$600.00} of that was our secured deposit. So why would they put in collections we owed {$800.00}, and how come each card was rounded off to the exact dollar amount the card was worth. So we are suppose to believe if there was any last minute charges coming in after we closed accounts, they just so happened to add up to {$800.00} on the nose dollar and cents. All XXXX cards. This has caused severe damage to XXXX peoples credit. And they are still dinging our credit. This has cost us so much heartache. We have tried to contact them several times, we never had a missed payment and they owed us a balance.

97185,97185,97185,Bank account or service,"Making/receiving payments, sending money","I 've just learned that when a person uses Capital One online Billpay they are at risk of having their money stolen by Capital One. Here 's how : When you approve an online bill payment the amount is debited from your account the moment you click "" send ''. Then a check is sent to the payee. However, if 90 days pass and that check has not been cashed or deposited Capital One never returns the money to the customer / PAYER 's account and never notifies the customer. They just keep the amount of the transaction. Forever. 

I 've just had this confirmed by a manager at Capital One. When I pressed him on Capital One therefore basically getting to keep my money he said "" no its in limbo '' but that is not true. The amount still remains on Capital One 's books as an asset because the money has never been transfered to another financial institution as would happen when the check was deposited or cashed and the cashing or depositing institution requests the funds from Capital One. Not only is this practice fraudulent but when questioned on it Capital One counted on my ignorance of how banking works to lie to me about how they benefit from the policy. 

In addition, while Capital One will never return your undistributed funds, the PAYEE only has 90 days to cash or deposit the check. You would think that after that same 90 days the funds would go back to the Customer / PAYER, but this is not the case. 

Therefore, in essence, every time you send out a check with Capital One 's online billpay, an invisible 90 day timer starts, and when it 's up the PAYEE ca n't collect, the PAYER is never notified, and Capital One gets to keep the customer 's funds. 

I have been informed by Capital One 's representatives that if you call and ask them to give the money back, they will, after charging you a fee. But If the PAYEE never informs you that they either did n't receive or deposit/cash the check Capital One never informs you, so you do n't even know to call and ask for your money back. Then they get to keep it. I 'm sure the combination of this policy, the lack of any notification from Capital One, and how they benefit is just a coincidence. 

The basic form of this situation is : 1. I ask Capital One to perform a financial transaction for me ( Bill Pay ) 2. Capital one debits the amount of the transaction from my account. 
3. The financial transaction does not complete within 90 days ( The Payee never receives or claims the funds ) 4. Capital one never notifies the customer that the transaction did not complete and never returns the funds. 

How can this policy and order of events, confirmed by Capital One, be described as anything other than fraud?",Capital One,DC,0.0529411764706

97803,97803,97803,Credit card,Other fee,"To whom it may concern : For over XXXX years now I have had a secured "" Platinum XXXX '' from CapitalOne. I originally applied for this card since it was solicited via mail as a good way to build or rebuild credit. As a young person, adding more cards to my portfolio made sense. 

That said, the card has been unused for over XXXX years. When I went online to review my accounts I saw I was charged a {$30.00} annual fee. While I do not have an object to annual fees as a rule, I was annoyed that CapitalOne now offers the same product, at no annual fee. 

When I called CapitalOne to transfer my card type and/or to waive the fee, they refused : stating "" bank regulations '' and other superficial reasons. Ultimately, I believe that the agent and his supervisor where ultimately powerless to help me. 

What I find truly disturbing is the institutional policy. Despite CapitalOne no longer charging an annual fee across any of their secured lines, they continue to do so on legacy accounts, and refuse to offer transfers that they regularly provide to other cardholders ( even for myself on a unsecured line ). 

What this means, practically speaking, is that the people who need financial help the most, those whom are working to rebuild their credit, are left with XXXX options : ( a ) close the account and -- this is the important part -- suffer the associated credit score hit by allowing the card to become inactive/closed or, XXXX b ) continue to pay a {$30.00} annual fee as ransom, even if the service is unused. 

Realistically, based on available simulations, a person could be looking at accepting a substantial XXXX point drop in their credit score if this card was used for its intended purpose ( e.g. rebuilding credit ) as a closure of an old card affects the "" average age of open accounts '' a highly-weighted scoring metric. 

It is my belief that this decision by CapitalOne to disallow secured accounts to be updated to the new terms is an intentional act designed to reap profits from the most vulnerable. Not only that, but I feel that it distinctly qualifies as a Clear Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices ( UDAAP ) under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX XXXX b ). 

From a moralistic prospective, the notion that customers should remained locked in a position where they are forced to continue to pay CapitalOne fees or face severe credit repercussions is obscene. To be clear, if this was a lucrative rewards card, this argument would be invalid. 

While my financial situation is excellent, even myself, whom has well over $ XXXX in unsecured revolving credit, is looking at a substantial negative credit hit by closing this otherwise unremarkable account. 

I am transmitting this letter on behalf of other customer whom likely lack the knowledge or means to raise this complaint. I believe this policy, intentional or otherwise, unfairly hurts the most vulnerable consumers, and ultimately is not in CapitalOne 's best interests. 

Beyond the reputational damage, the practice of refusing to update the card -- or allow consumers to do so -- is petty and antithetical to the "" consumer friendly '' and "" helpful '' atmosphere CapitalOne attempts to promote. 

I would like to request your assistance in this matter to advocate for a change in policy as well as to see the necessary changes effected onto my account.",Capital One,PA,0.0366219008264

101857,101857,101857,Credit card,Payoff process,"Capital One Bank ( USA ) , N.A . ( "" the Bank '' ) is engaging in unfair, deceptive, abusive acts and practices by violating my rights under the account holder agreement for my Capital One Visa Platinum account. I recently relocated to a new state and updated my billing information with the Bank. Apparently this modification triggered a fraud alert in their system, which prevents me from accessing any account information ; information I need to remit payments and review ( 1 ) my balance, ( 2 ) account activity, including debits and credits, and ( 3 ) a copy of my rights under the account holder agreement. At the encouragement of the Bank, I foolishly enrolled in online statements, I do n't receive paper statements regularly. As a result, this system that is now prohibiting my access is my only source of this data. 

While I am not particularly concerned about ever using this account to make purchases again, I believe that Capital One is violating a number of consumer protection laws by not sharing my current balance or transaction data with me until I produce an onerous amount of documentation to prove who I am ( apparently the multiple telephone identity verification processes and desire to pay my bill are not sufficient proof of who I am ). The Bank does not have the authority to make such a demand or, if they do, I would n't know because I am unable to access a copy of my account holder agreement to review my rights. 

A large bank like Capital One should know that there are many identity verification services such as XXXX XXXX or even the USPS change of address system that would provide ample proof to the Bank of who I am and that I relocated. 

This action may be pervasive and affecting consumers at large. I encourage the CFPB to issue a Civil Investigatory Demand ( CID ) to the Bank to determine whether or not this is a widespread issue. This fraud block prevents a consumer from accessing information needed in order to pay their bill, potentially causing severe harm to consumers. I believe that this demonstrates, at best, willful neglect on the part of Capital One Bank who would certainly continue to charge additional interest and late penalties, furnish data to credit reporting agencies or charge off this account should I fail to remit regular payment on this account. 

Other, more responsible financial institutions, have implemented effective alternative methods to ensure that accounts with suspected fraudulent activity do not incur additional charges while still allowing the account holder to access relevant data about their account. 

I was able to obtain an unverified total current balance from the fraud manager who I spoke with after I was told it was a violation of their policy/procedure to provide this information to me. I have remitted a payment for this full amount to the Bank, although I have not had an opportunity to review the transactions which make up this balance.",Capital One,NY,0.100614336644

I declined and asked what he was talking about. He finally stated it 's a Capital One credit card debt from 15 years ago. He started making some snide comments and I told him that I 'm not sure about this debt, but if it 's been 15 years you will have to forget about it. I told him not to call ever again and had to hang-up because he kept speaking. I 've had plenty of calls since then but did not answer because of the XXXX area code. But today this XXXX got me and wanted to get me to pay despite my repeated attempts to ascertain the nature of the call. She said it 's a Capital One credit card debt from 15 years ago that was {$200.00} that they usuriously grew to over {$5000.00}. I talked over her telling her to not call again and I could n't make out what she was threatening to do. I 'm sure over a decade ago I sent them a written desist demand. They keep pulling my credit report and harassing me. I want them to stop contacting me and stop pulling my credit report, They are a less than reputable company and have grown because there are a lot of foolish people that do business with them, or have they changed?

In the last 30 days I have received two emails form Capital One stating as below ( in quotes, italicized ) : "" Our fraud defenses flagged one or more purchase ( s ) below as unusual for your VISA SIGNATURE card ending in XXXX. Do you or an authorized user recognize these purchases? If we 've already spoken about this, you can ignore this email. 

Some things to consider when reviewing your purchases : If a dollar amount differs from your record, it could be a pre-authorization. For example, many gas stations pre-authorize an amount ( usually between $ XXXX- {$75.00} ) because they do n't know how much gas you 'll pump.

My FICO credit score is above XXXX. I had paid in full the card balance listed in each statement since the commencement of the card, so I assume that is a reason that for Capital One may label me as a "" bad customer '' who can not be charged late fees and interest. I have over XXXX reward points for my purchases on my Capital One credit card. 
In my opinion, Capital One is making consolidated efforts to take away these reward points by discouraging me from normal use of my credit card. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I had spoken twice with Capital One Customer Service supervisors asking why I am getting cited emails and which transactions are suspicious. Last conversation was with XXXX, ID # XXXX. Neither supervisor was able to explain why I am getting emails, and which transaction triggers it. However, they confirmed that my credit card might be suspended if I do not validate transactions listed in the email. In both conversations my request for a written explanation was denied. Agents of Capital One also denied fixing an issue and any written assurance that Capital One will make any necessary steps to avoid closing accounts and sending emails for non-specified reasons. 
I am finding the actions of Capital One as a consistent and elevated effort to violate card agreement by the discouragement of customers like me to use their accounts and gain rewards that are part of the agreement, or to further to take away reward points. 
In summary, I am asking The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to record my complaint and possibly check if Capital One 's practices fall into standards of the banking industry.",Capital One,PA,0.0806818181818

I had been instructed to send a copy of a state identification card, social security card and proof of street address. Before sending the same, I verified the validity of the three letters. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I faxed the requested document to the number provided by Capital One. To date, the company still claims that it has not received the same.

However, since people have different situations maybe this review pertains more to you. 

Background : My credit score is XXXX out of a possible XXXX. I 've never once had a late payment to anyone over the past fifty years. I 've recommended Capital One many times to friends because they do n't charge 1 % for charges overseas. 

My reward for the customer loyalty is utter incompetence on the one occasion that I 've had a problem. Capital One 's Fraud Department is grossly incompetent. 

Brief rundown after more than two weeks of daily phone calls : 1. Despite obvious fraud ( {$15000.00} at an XXXX XXXX halfway across the country from where I live ) Capital One did n't catch this. There was no credit warning. I found the charges online and had to call them. They took all my information and shut down my account saying the case would be addressed within 72 hours and that I would receive a phone call. 
2. No phone call. When I called them after 72 hours nothing at all had been done. There were no notes in the account of anyone in the Fraudulent Fraud Department having even looked at the issue. They then told me that to initiate the investigation I had to drive 45 minutes to my bank and have the bank manager call them to identify me. I did that. Capital One then told the bank manager that I 'd received incorrect information and that I had to email them a copy of my driver 's licence. 
3. I emailed them my driver 's license and waited another 72 hours. Again, no one called. I called them. After many long holds I was told that the driver 's license was n't what they needed. I needed to find my original Social Security Card from XXXX years ago and send them a copy. 
4. I did send them a copy of my SS card along with a bill stating my name and address. Another XXXX hours and no contact. I called them back. 
5. They then told me that the SS card and bill were not adequate, so I needed to drive to the bank and have the bank manager call to identify me. See # 2 above. Second trip to the bank. 
6. The bank manager called Capital One. They took his number at the bank and said they would call him back at that number. Forty-five minutes ; no call. The bank manager called back. They had copied down his number incorrectly. 
7. They said that they had contacted me through a text to my phone. I had told them previously that the thief had also stolen my phone number. Capital One insisted on texting information on how to gain access to my account to the THIEF. I asked several times for them to take my new phone number. They refused to take the correct phone number. 
8. Their phone lines drop calls constantly and they will not allow you to speak to the person who just spoke to you, nor will they take your phone number, so you start the process over time and time again. 
9. When I finally got someone competent on the phone his first reaction was that he was stunned. He could n't believe what had happened, beginning with no fraud alert on an obviously fraudulent purchase and ending with the fact that no one in the Fraudulent Department had taken note of which purchases were fraudulent. ( This was at least the tenth call. ) So he took note of the problematic charges and STARTED ANOTHER 72 HOUR INVESTIGATION. 
10. He did issue another card finally, which I will close as soon as I extract my rewards points. However, he also shut down my online account. I need to login again when the new card comes for security reasons. The problem is that Capital One has taken so long that I have a payment due in two days.

I was told if I use my debit card to make payment, it would take 5 days. I asked Capital One to cancel payment and I would use my debit card, so I could get my title 10 days sooner. XXXX Bank would not approve the transaction, though I had over XXXX in my checking account, statting I ; m only allowed maxium of XXXX for day for purchases. I asked if they could make an exception for this one time payment, explaining I sold my car and need to pay off loan and get title ASAP. They still refused stating the cash I deposited 2 days prior still has not been processed. I called the next day Wed ( XXXX/XXXX/17 ), they still refused to allow me to pay off my loan with one time payment of approx {$3900.00}.

It occurred to me I should be able to pay {$2000.00} to Capital One, as this is below XXXX limit for purchases. When I called capital one auto finace they told me though I made payment that day, because it was after XXXX, the payment would not post until next day -- XXXX/XXXX/17. I was told by capital one I can not call on XXXX/XXXX/17, the next day and make an additional payment because I am only allowed to make XXXX payment per day -- so I was unable to called them on XXXX/XXXX/17 and make a payment due to this ridiculous policy. When I called Capital One Auto finance on Friday XXXX/XXXX/17 to pay the remaining balance on my auto loan, using my XXXX XXXX card -- approx XXXX, I was told the payment which I made prior to XXXX, would not be processed until Monday.

I called XXXX Bank to find out if Capital One processed any such payment and was told No. I also noted in my account -- -- when I made $ XXXX to Capital One Auto Finance on XXXX/XXXX/17, the payment was not processed by them until Friday XXXX/XXXX/17. These practices made by Capital One Auto Finace to delay my payemnt and what it seems to collect more interest on my loan is VERY DECEPTIVE PRACTICE. I had more than enough money to pay my loan in one day and be done, but XXXX Bank wanted to dictate to me how much of my own money I can spend in a given day which is so ridiculous. Thanks to both these institutions, there is now a delay in getting the title for my car and selling it to my buyer. This also causes a delay in me purchasing a new car, because I was going to use profit from money I get from seller to put a downpayment towards an new car.

They claim they have no evidence of my having applied for the interest-free card offer ( for a term ), and therefore wo n't correct their mistake of sending me a card with interest. 

XXXX XXXX, 2016 To Accounts Supervisor, I am contacting you to rectify a situation. I recently opened a credit card with Capital One, due to the offer of added miles with a purchase of $ XXXX within a time frame, and no-interest payments for over a year. I charged $ XXXX to my new card on XXXX/XXXX/16, and received the first email copied below, dated XXXX. For some reason, the link to "" make a payment '' was n't working, but I made my {$100.00} payment the following month. I had also called to ask for the specific date on which my no-interest period ends, but I was put on hold for a very long period, and no one came back to answer my question. I called back another day to inquire again, and was told that I have no offer for no-interest payments! 

This floored me, and I am very disturbed and distressed about this situation! I specifically signed up for the card, because of the no-interest offer for a period of time, and I knew I 'd need this, because I was intending to use it for the very large purchase that I 'd anticipated. It is unacceptable that my terms are now with interest charged! I was told that perhaps I had accidentally selected the wrong card offer, but I do n't see how I could have done this! I hope that this is just an error on the part of Capital One, and not a bait-and-switch scheme, which is what it feels like. Once again, it is unsatisfactory that I am now being charged interest on my purchase! I never would have gotten this card with interest, knowing that I was about to make a $ XXXX purchase! I am escalating this to you, because I need this situation rectified, to where I have no interest for the term. Thank you for your immediate assistance. 
Regards, XXXX XXXX - close of letter - P.S. On a recorded conversation, a rep looked up the offers about the time of my application, and found that the "" XXXX XXXX '' card had the offer I wanted, but they sent me the '' XXXX '' card, which does n't have an interest-free offer. They made the mistake of sending the wrong card, but said they ca n't change the card now. I contend that it is their mistake ; they must be accountable and give me a card with no-interest payments for the same term.",Capital One,CA,-0.0489991432179

Upon query, their representative attempted to tell me I responded to a 5-6 month 0 % APR, and if not that, then they changed the terms after reviewing my credit, and she offered to send me that documentation. However, my statements do not have any interest charges for 10 months, ( as expected for 0 % for at least 10 months, and do not support her assertion I was on a 5-6 month 0 % ), until the most recent statement that I contacted them about. She continued to assert the falsehood of my offer ( 5-6 months 0 % ) or the other falsehood ( they changed after credit review ) until I got the point across that obviously it is not as she said as I was not charged interest until after 10 months. She ultimately waived my interest for this month but I expect to have the same problem next month. What I am sincerely disappointed by is the assertion of falsehood which is tantamount to a bait and switch scenario, despite the fact I have evidence supporting my 12 month introductory 0 % APR, and the fact that it took over 30 minutes to resolve one issue and my expectation to have to spend another call next month to waive the interested again so that they would have honored their 12 month introductory 0 % APR.",Capital One,OH,0.0140625

# 1, I do have proof that there was a card in the name of XXXX sent to my house on my account, I had a witness present. 
# 2 As well, I did not have a card with CAPITAL ONE that was not secure, card ending XXXX was indeed a secured card. We did not have any cards at the time that were not secured. 
# 3. On every account, I made my payments on time. And just to make mention of XXXX card, on card XXXX, the amount of deposit was XXXX for a XXXX credit. You were in possession of the XXXX security deposit and I made XXXX payment. The cards are not unlimited cards in that we went well over the XXXX balance. So If I had a XXXX deposit, and I made a payment of XXXX, Assuming that I did use the whole balance on the card, then the card balance would have only been {$170.00} in which the XXXX deposit should have taken care of that in which you would have owed me money. The issue, is all the cards, I see that I made a payment after, and each card had a secured deposit of well over half of the value of the card, and I must assure you that we did not have a XXXX card that was unsecured. 
# 4. I spoke to a FRAUD person on the phone, and I canceled the cards due to identity theft issues, not only was there a witness, in XXXX 2012, we had witnesses tell us that our CAPITAL ONE credit cards were being used by someone who had stolen the cards. A police report was made and you were notified. I have over hundred emails and faxes and several companies had tried to get a hold of you. 
# 5 Furthermore, on XXXX XXXX, 2012, we had our whole entire apartment robbed, and we were also beaten on the property, as well as our personal records, and such were taken as well as several of our CAPITAL ONE CARDS. So when we filled out the police reports we not only put the cards in the report, we faxed CAPITAL ONE a copy of this XX/XX/XXXX, and we had already closed the accounts, as I said, we talked to the FRAUD DEPARTMENT as I said. So, all the letters sent after the accounts were closed I am not sure I understand, we put down {$600.00} on the {$750.00} card ending XXXX, if you look at the date, it was XX/XX/XXXX, it was first card I got, it makes common sense that it would have been a secured card too as I did not qualify for any other card from CAPITAL ONE at the time. 
Card ending XXXX XXXX deposit, XXXX limit, and and I paid {$330.00} after closing card. So, XXXX plus XXXX is {$750.00} and the secured cards do n't go over the amount the card has limit for. So, {$930.00} you were in possession of for the {$750.00} card on close. And that is even if the bill was at {$750.00} at close I already explained card ending in XXXX, and the other XXXX follow. I made payments all the way through, I paid balances of a couple times a months on each card. And I made a payment a day or so after closing accounts in good faith bringing the account balances back, even though the cards were in others possessions and used without our consent, I still made the effort to CAPITAL ONE. 
On all XXXX cards, I put {$1900.00} secured deposit, and all together the cards only equaled a value of {$2500.00}. so, if at best, I was to have owed anything it would have been {$600.00}.

I came into XXXX XXXX to purchase a vehicle because I had gotten several pieces of mail saying I was pre approved for a loan up to {$30000.00} from Capital one. I am a XXXX and had a fico score of XXXX at that time. The interest rate I was given was 21.74 % and the dealer told me that i had to purchase a warranty for {$2200.00} to qualify although I was presented with a paper to sign saying that I did not. Along the term of this loan I have had two instances where i was approved for due date changes that I did not receive and cause me to have late payments on my credit history. Also I was told over the phone that I was approved for an extension and did not receive that either and caused my payments to pile up. I feel that here it is three years later and I still owe {$23000.00} of the initial {$28000.00} I have borrowed with almost three years of payments of {$710.00} and still have three more years to go. This loan was predatory and I feel that I was taken advantage of. I could not refinance because I 'm so upside down and have no hopes of trading it in either.

The owners of the business are XXXX and XXXX and do a TV show called XXXX XXXX. We took the 3 day course in XXXX and were told this was a great market for flipping homes. The people who taught the class were excellent sales people but had no idea of the XXXX housing market. The lead trainer was from XXXX. They spent the first day getting every one pumped up on how much money we could make and the second day, they had us sit down with their assistants at lunch and we were told to call as many credit card companies as we could and charge as much as we could because we would make it back on our first flip. They guaranteed they would work with us until we make the money back. This means a phone call. I am now over {$20.00} in credit card debit with a terrible credit score. My credit score was very good before this disaster. We were both interested in XXXX. The staff was very professional and skilled. The leader was XXXX XXXX known as the ( XXXX ). He was very good at what he does -- building people up to a big dream and then enticing them to pay big money for it. On day 2 of the seminar they offered us a package after pumping us up on day 1. He told us this was the perfect time to get into the XXXX in our area. He showed us the market was on the upswing in the XXXX XXXX area particularly. We would be able to make a lot of money. He talked about many success stories and that it was n't that difficult if you just follow the easy steps. Look for properties, look for investors and buyers, and continue to develop an income stream. Easier said than done! On day 2 we called as many credit card companies as we could to see how much credit we could get. He never explained that this would lower your credit score, not allow you to qualify for any type of loan or line of credit because of your high credit card debt. We only qualified for hard money lending which we would be unable to pay back because that would mean we would make no profit on the house we were flipping. Next problem, the flipping market high tide was 4 years ago when people made their money in this area. We have talked to local real estate investors, realtors, contractors, gone to investment club meetings, talked to other class members and found what I have just stated to be true. Also, if you could find a house, the ones that have already been rehabbed beautifully in the XXXX XXXX. area continue to sit on the market and they keep lowering the price because the area is not desirable to live in. The only people that can make money are the ones who already have money and can pay in cash.

I have been working on my credit for over a year to raise my score in order to be able to qualify for a home purchase. A few months ago I established a Capitol One Bank credit card so that I could establish more credit. Everything was fine and good until I never received a bill from them. 

Because I never received a bill from them I attempted to call them. I attempted to call them with both numbers on the back of the card. Every time I tried calling them, I would never get to a representative, i would get hung up on, or sometimes I would be transferred to some XXXX representative. Well today after still not receiving a bill and not being able to contact them I tried one more time. I was not satisfied at all with the entire process. Capitol One is reporting me 30 days late. When I called today I decided to record the call so that I had proof of the craziness and arduous process one has to go trough to get to capitol one. 

When I called the number on the back of the card, I could not get to a representative. I had to repeat myself multiple times for the machine to recognize my request. Even after I was FINALLY able to speak to a representative, I almost hung up because after they answered, no one was on the line for nearly 20 seconds. I had to say Hello many many times before the representative XXXX finally answered. Once he answered things did n't get better ... 

When I spoke to him he admitted that he did n't have my address but he also would n't tell me what address he had on file for me. He said it was a security precaution even though the system verified me before speaking to him ... When I told him my problem he did n't care and said he could n't correct the late payment reporting because not getting a bill and not being able to contact them was not a reason to fix it ... That is a lie. I own a XXXX myself and I know that I ca n't simply send someone to collections or place an account in delinquent status if I do n't bill them first. Instead of helping me he decided to transfer me to a supervisor. 

The supervisor was no better. I will attempt to shorten this as I am running out of space but essentially she agreed that they did n't have my address at first but now they do. She said she would submit a dispute on my behalf to the bureaus.. I told her why would she do that when I could do it myself. What I wanted to know is if Capitol One would remove the late payments as they have n't billed me and I am unable to get in contact with them. She said she could not remove the late payments because they did n't control credit reporting but the credit bureaus did. I know that is a lie and I told her I knew it was as credit bureaus do not control reporting rather they are keepers of information. She then said that they do n't simply push a button in order to report or not report. I told her I knew that was a lie too as companies send their reporting to the bureaus electronically. She still would n't agree to remove anything even though they know I never got a bill since they did n't have my address. Even after attempting to pay them they still were giving me trouble! They could n't accept my debit card for unknown reasons! If I did n't have my checkbook I still would n't be able to pay them and would probably have more late payments reporting. 

In other words, I 've never received a bill, I ca n't reach them until today, even when I do reach them, it takes 30 seconds to respond which almost causes me to hang up. They do n't have my address, they blatantly lie to me about credit reporting procedures, they ca n't even accept my legitimate XXXX debit card for payment! How is this fair or a legitimate business practice? If they ca n't remove these late payments that stem due to no fault of my own, my credit will be ruined. Help me!",Capital One,CA,0.111742424242

110369,110369,110369,Bank account or service,Deposits and withdrawals,"Complaint submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Board ( CFPB ) About Capital One By XXXX XXXX, a Capital One customer XXXX XXXX, 2017 With Capital One, I have a checking account, a savings account and XXXX credit cards. 

I transferred {$500.00} from an account I have at XXXX to my savings account at Capital One. 
Capital One has received my {$500.00}. It is in my "" Accounts Summary '' as part of the "" Current Balance. '' Screenshot submitted with this complaint. 

I tried to transfer {$300.00} from savings to checking - both accounts at Capital One - and was told there were insufficient funds. 2nd screenshot submitted with this complaint. 

I had a chat with XXXX at Capital One. She was very knowledgable and professional in explaining Capital One 's rule about this. PDF of chat submitted with this complaint. 

As I understand Capital One 's rule, when they receive funds from an external source, like XXXX, they do not release those funds to their Capital One customer right away. 

Instead, they wait several days to make sure that the external source, XXXX in this situation, will not demand return of the funds. 

Capital One refers to this acceptance of the funds and waiting - verification of the funds. 

Only after verification of the funds are the funds released to the customer. At that time, they show up in the "" Available Balance. '' See a screenshot submitted with this complaint. 

Capital One does not pay me interest on my funds ( {$500.00} in this situation ) until the funds are notated under "" Available Balance. '' It is my understanding of the effect of this rule of Capital One is that Capital One has my money XXXX {$500.00} XXXX. It will have my money until either the external source XXXX XXXX XXXX demands its return or Capital One releases it to me. This "" verification '' can take XXXX5 days once Capital One has received the funds. 

This complaint is submitted on XXXX/XXXX/2017. I understand my money will not be released to me until XXXX. 

I must assume that the people at Capital One are smart business people. Until proven otherwise, I can only assume that they are using my money to make money. 

And, they are not paying me interest for the use of my money to make money for Capital One. 

I want Capital One to pay me interest from the time my money is received by Capital One until it is either returned to the external source ( XXXX ) or made available to me. 

I want the Federal Government to make it a rule or a law that banks are required to do this. 

The right side of this complaint is not showing up in the box to submit the complaint, so I am attaching it as a PDF. 

Please note that the actions by Capital One covered by this complaint are similar to - but not the same as - the taking of customers ' funds by Capital One in CFPB Case Number XXXX.",Capital One,NY,0.00285714285714

Aside from not allowing consumers to provide any details regarding their disputes in Capital One 's online dispute forms or to submit messages electronically -- either securely through their online accounts ( a feature which existed previously but has recently been eliminated by Capital One ) or via email -- the merchant has a policy of both requiring supporting documentation prior to submitting a claim and also permanently rescinding credit issued in connection with claims as soon as said claims are disputed by the merchants in question without giving consumers a chance to rebut the merchants ' response. 

On XXXX I submitted a dispute ( Case # : XXXX ) in connection with a charge for {$2000.00} from XXXX/XXXX/2016 against an attorney who had actively assisted the State of Florida in retaliating against me for trying to call attention to abuses which the State of Florida systematically inundates HUD Programs with in order to undermine the Civil Rights Act, made possible by the criminally unethical practice of allowing County Judges to adjudicate landlord-tenant disputes involving HUD rules without being qualified or authorized to do so -- even in circumstances where County Judges are specifically requested to disqualify themselves from such cases because of the financial ties which all County Judges must have to any landlords who participate in HUD 's programs within any Municipality wherein HUD 's Programs are not fully privatized. Despite the vast amounts of evidence I sent in via fax detailing at great length the unethical conduct of the attorney, Capital One rescinded the credit issued in connection with my dispute on XXXX/XXXX/2016, immediately after the attorney disputed my claim.

1. In a Capital One letter, Capital One claimed that I accepted their offer for a loan that included a {$450.00} deposit. I never accepted their offer. 
2. Capital One provided NO evidence of acceptance of their offer. The reason is that they do not have any such evidence because I NEVER signed their acceptance letter.

Best Regards, XXXX XXXX replied stating that he does not have the authority to reverse the charges and referred us to his manager XXXX XXXX at XXXX. I attempted to call this number but it was dysfunctional at the time. I attempted to call XXXX XXXX about 3-4 times, but XXXX never returned any of those phone calls.

Also, the phone number you provided for your manager is a bad number and I have informed you of this a couple days ago but you have not yet replies with a good number! Please reply with a valid phone number for your manager. 
As you know, I never gave you authority to charge my CC. Neither did I provide such authority to anyone else at Capital One. I have already requested that you reverse this charge and I am now demanding that you reverse this charge immediately. Not doing so immediately will result in a major escalation as I do not appreciate this under-handed approach.

Over the last 3 days my wife has received a call a day from a computer claiming to be Kohl 's and insisting that she enter part of her social security number. This of course is the *definition* of a fraudulent call, compounded by the fact that Kohl 's POS systems were very recently broken into and information stolen. When my wife called to alert them to these robocalls, it turns out that these calls were to notify us that our card was past due, with a {$25.00} fee etc. After bullying my way through customer service ( after the XXXXline in XXXX told me that the XXXX line would refuse to take my call ), the late fee was scrubbed, the balance paid off, and the account closed permanently. 

My complaint is twofold : 1 ) Their autopay system silently failed to operate, and while talking with customer "" service '' I found that the website shows no hint of autopay even existing. The agent claimed that if the account is in arrears it wo n't allow changes to autopay, but that 's very different from the autopay being completely scrubbed from the site. 
2 ) Their automated phone system requires the customer to enter part of their social security number over an unsecured channel. This "" standard practice '' of theirs is the worst possible method, as it sounds like a fraudulent call. I strongly suspect they actually *want* it to sound like fraud so people will ignore it and end up with even more late fees. The industry-standard method is to tell the customer to call back at a given number, or best case tell the customer to "" call the number on the back of your card '' because a fraudulent call can just as easily give a fraudulent call-back number. 

The account in question is permanently closed ( I have had more trouble with this XXXX card than with the sum of all other cards I 've ever had ), but their practices live on and they give no indication that they are willing to correct them.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Capital One writes me and stated that the merchant provided the above documentation thus they were rebilling my account {$750.00}. 

Capital One has violated Federal Law and owes me a penalty of {$1000.00}. 

My complaint pertains to the handling of my dispute under the XXXX, Truth in Lending, Regulation Z and applicable case law. The facts in this case are rather simple. I ordered merchandise. The merchandise came damaged. I contacted the merchant rejecting the merchandise by stating it is damaged and requesting the merchant to pick it up. The merchant agreed to pick it up and credit but did not. This same scenerio has been reviewed in the courts as far back as XXXX. Capital One knows this but is not following established law. 
In this case Capital One ignored the law and made me go beyond what was required by physcially sending back the merchandise. All while Capital One rebilled my account and demanded payment. A clear violation of Federal Law. 

See XXXX v. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Missouri Supreme Court applying Truth in Lending, Fair Credit Billing Acts and Regulation Z. 

XXXX XXXX argued that XXXX did not properly reject the ceiling fan because he did not return it. The court disagreed saying : "" a buyer that rescinds the contract and holds the merchandise as bailee for the seller is not liable for the sale price. UCC Section 400.2-602 ( XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX. A buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods it has rejected. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX citing section 400.2-602 ( 2 ) ). The seller bears the cost of return delivery. '' This case is applying the Uniform Commercial Code of which is the same in all states. 

In my case I clearly told Capital One that I had rejected the damaged merchandise and that the seller was free to pick it up. At the time that I informed the merchant that the merchandise was damaged and I wanted it picked up I had no further obligation. The merchant did not respond my saying they attempted to pick up the merchandise or that I refused to allow them to pick up the merchandise. With this, Capital One placed the charge back on my account and demanded payment.

I even got a car loan with the same bank and paid off the loan with no late payments. Unfortunately, I became unemployed and homeless and did not have an income to pay my card payments. The card was closed and the account balance more than doubled with fees. Now that I am employed again, I researched a contact number for the bank who issued the credit card and I called them to find out the balance and if I could make payment arrangements. I talked to a manager who said they would make a one time adjustment to the balance and they gave me the total. I asked if I paid the balance would they contact the credit agencies stating the account was paid in full. I was told, "" Yes. '' I asked if they could send me a letter to that effect and they said they would. I received a letter shortly after thanking me for agreeing to pay the balance by such and such a date. At no time in our conversation on the phone did the manager ever mention a date I had to pay the account by nor did I agree to pay by a certain date. I was told on the phone that once I paid the balance they would wait 22 days to make sure the funds cleared then they would contact the credit bureaus saying the account was paid. Now the letter was stating I had roughly 10 days to pay the lowered amount agreed upon or the original balance would be back in force. I sacrificed my paycheck and made sure I had called them to pay over the phone thinkng I could use my debit card. After waiting an extended amount of time on hold, I finally got through to a representative who informed me they do n't take payments via debit cards ; it had to be a credit card or check by phone. I do n't use checks so I had to get the routing and account number in order to proceed. I got the information and called the bank back. Again, it was a long hold time before speaking with a representative. I gave her my information and the payment went through.

They continue to bill my account this erroneous charge and fail to show any proof of a second charge from their end. At least XXXX XXXX was able to run the card and see that they did not charge a second time.

114349,114349,114349,Credit card,Closing/Cancelling account,"I applied for a secured credit card with Capital One. I was approved and I initiated a deposit much higher than requested for a larger line. During the deposit process, their system went down and when it came back up it did n't confirm that the deposit had gone through, so I started over and did the whole process again. This time it gave me confirmation and I thought all was fine. Well, come to find out after the fact, the first deposit went through so they had it twice. Should n't be a big deal, right? Wrong ... .I contacted them and told them of the issue and was told that once they have the funds they ca n't return them if I want the card. The said if I wanted the funds back I 'd either have to totally cancel the card or I could go to my bank and put a stop payment on XXXX of the deposits. So, that 's what I did ... I put a stop payment on XXXX of the deposits. Instead of correcting the situation it only made it worse. When I received the card, I called the number on the front to activate it and was immediately kicked over to the fraud department. They proceeded to tell me that there was now a problem with the card because of XXXX of the deposits being returned. I informed them that was what I was instructed to do. They said that someone in the backroom was handling it and they would send them an e-mail to call me. I never received a call so after a few days I called again and got the same story but asked to speak to a supervisor. He said there was nothing he could do that it was being investigated by the "" magical '' back room '' and they would contact me. Again, no contact other than a letter stating my credit card line had been decreased in half because of a partial return of deposit which was correct. Since I received that letter I thought all was fine ... .wrong. I activated the card and tried to use it and was declined. I called Capital One and they informed me the account was closed. Huh ... what? so I asked to speak to a supervisor and after going round and round with her for 30 minutes was told they had sent my other deposit back and the account was closed. I told her I had n't received the funds back which she confirm with Capital One bank. I told her all I wanted was a credit card so transfer my information to a new account and take the deposit again. She told me that could only be decided by the "" back room '' and they would have to call me. XXXX from the supposed "" back room '' called back 3 days later and said there was nothing that can be done and if I wanted a new account that I could apply. That sent me into a rage ... I told her I did n't want another inquiry on my account and she said that 's the way they process .... ( IT 'S A SECURED CARD ) where 's the risk anyway? She proceeded to tell me this was not their mistake and that I caused the whole incident by stopping a payment on XXXX of the unauthorized deposit debits. What a XXXX that 's the instructions they have given me ... I asked to speak to someone over her and she refused stating she did n't have to give me anyone 's name to discuss this with. She kept telling me to be professional which only incited me more as she kept reading her script. So now, I have no credit card and I have yet to receive my XXXX deposit back which they mailed. Why would they mail it when I bank with them? They act like they 're not part of the same organization.

He said no problem, I will process the payment over the phone, I said but I wanted to use my kohl 's card today and cash payments post right away for use. He said no we can use your debit card and you can use your card right away. I know by him saying that, that there is no way they would let me use my card unless that money came out.

114543,114543,114543,Credit card,Transaction issue,"I have a credit card with Capital One. it has a small balance and the {$26.00} minimum payment was due XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/17, I made a payment for {$26.00} online, but it was erroneously from a bank account I had closed, that was still listed on Capital One 's site. I did n't realize this. I then made what I thought was an extra payment for {$26.00} on XXXX, from my Cap one bank account online. When on the credit card 's site, I can choose the bank account to pay the payment from. I have a Cap One checking and savings account, and it said the available balance was {$37.00} on XXXX account, and {$46.00} on the other. So either account should be able to handle a {$26.00} payment. 

As it turns out, this payment was rejected too, saying insufficient funds. After realizing this I called and Cap one said that they were holding the last {$15.00} deposit for verification from my bank, XXXX Bank. Which I understand -- but that should n't be listed in the available balance then and it is with Capital One when I am trying to pay the credit card online. This is grossly misleading at best, and just plain fraudulent in my opinion. Available balance is supposed to be the funds that are available, not that ones that will be available. So, with that payment being returned, I was n't aware and after thinking I was paying extra for the month, the payment for this month was n't made on time at all and I incurred a late fee and possible late on my credit report. Capital One has removed the late fee but say they ca n't say how the account will report. When I look at the payment history for the credit card, it shows payments of {$26.00} made on XXXX and XXXX. NOWHERE on that transaction history does it state those payments were returned or reversed. So this is false, as well as the available balance on the checking and savings. I believe it they are providing misleading and false information that is a detriment to my credit history and financial status.

I liquidated my retire plan to catch up on mortgage and other expenses. I eventually found a job with The state of Florida where I make only about XXXX a year. As a result of a drastic change in income I fell behind my mortgage for about 2 months. I have been making at least one full payment each month since I fell behind. I started a loan modification process about XXXX to 4 months a go in XXXX or XXXX XXXX. I submitted initial documents requested. I was asked to submit additional documents which I did. The main issue is, capital one is intentionally delaying the process to force me into foreclosure because I strongly believe the company is in to make gains and not care about my plight at all. The ask for my monthly pay stub, I send it, they sit on the document, until a new pay period then they send a nasty letter that if I do not send a new paystub my case will be closed. I did that about 3 times. The other part is, they requested my insurance declaration page, which I sent, it was confirmed they have it, now they are asking for the same document-I thought my information or documents were to be kept securely. I requested so many times for the case worker to call me back but she would not. When I asked for corporate number there is none. 
To add salts to injury, Capital one sat on my application for about three months when I was told underwriter reviewed my application and I needed this document and that document only to submit all required documents and then being told a box on my application was not checked. My question is if a box was not checked, why did they not send me back the document for me to check what is needed but rather waited until I submitted all required documents to send me a letter I received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX asking me to check a box on a page but they did not bother to include the document I needed to check of. To prove how eager ( it seems someone makes personal gains when a XXXX is pushed through foreclosure especially if the how value has almost doubled like mine ) capital one 360 home loan is to foreclose my house, I was given 4 days from the time I receive the letter to check off a box on a form that was not included in the envelope and return or else I will not be able to stop foreclosure once a foreclosure sale date is set. 
Why should capital one 360 keep asking for the same documents I sent, some I sent so many times then threaten foreclosure due to their in ability to send me a form they sat on with their underwriters for about three months, then sending threatening foreclosure letter asking me to check a box on a ducument they did not include in the envelope. Could Capital One 360 Home loans not have sent this document along with all the several request they made on my pay stubs for me to complete right from the onset? This is a deliberate attempt.

However I had administered her estate and all if her assets had been distributed before I became aware that this banking account existed. By the time i became aware of the Capital One account, the estate had been discharged. I was advised to provide them a court order reflecting that I was in fact the personal representative, a copy of her death certificate and a direction to pay letter advising how I wanted the funds distributed. I provided all three. I specificlly requested that they issue the check to me as there was no longer an estate. At no time would Capital One disclose either the account number or the amount of funds contained within it. A week later I recieved a call advising my request was denied because they would not issue the check to me without a "" Small Estate Affidavit '' and another direction to pay letter. At that time I advised them that Florida, the state of my mother 's residence and closed estate, did not recognize a Small Estate Affidavit. I was told the check would not be released to me without one, so I prepared a notarized "" Small Estate Form '' and a new Direction to Pay letter requesting the funds be sent to me as the personal representative and heir of my mother 's estate. On XX/XX/2016, I received a call from Capital One advising they did not need any further documents and they would be releasing the funds in a check made out to the estate of my mother.

I said OK I will wait for you to ask again, but before she placed me on hold she began to read me the authorization RSNIP to complete my payment of {$200.00}. I told her "" No, I do not authorize you to process my payment until you confirm my late fee will be waved ''. The rep told me SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PROCESS MY PAYMENT BEFORE CONFIRMING THE LATE FEE WILL STILL BE WAVED. This was a clear act of discrimination based on me increasing the amount I wanted to pay.

I would like a case opened as the 2nd call I placed I was told they could not take my payment while the recorded calls were being investigated. It took a THIRD call for someone to tell me I was able to "" catch up '' with the late payment ( that I had already authorized to take back in XX/XX/XXXX, but was not processed on their end ) to avoid a continual late fee.

I said to the guy "" Are you nuts? Why would I let you lower my fee so that I would just pay MORE interest over a longer period of time?

From : You have to contact the credit bureau, we ca n't give you an answer, you have to contact them and then we 'll see if we can re-open it, sir I have told you 4 times I CAN NOT GIVE YOU AN ANSWER to the phone hanging up at Capital One twice.

So, because I could n't have an answer, a letter, a message, or a simple justification from Capital One, nor from XXXX I only can ask to my self something .... Did they closed my account because I was paying on time and they was n't making any money out of me? Did they closed my account because I was paying some collection bills to fix my credit with the same credit card I was as well paying on time, every 15 days? 
I wish someone could give me an answer, because at the end of the day, the results of building and fixing my credit score, turns into a nightmare for me and I totally get the opposite results, because now I do n't have credit and I have to start all over again thanks to Capital One and XXXX.",Capital One,DE,-0.0527777777778

We paid the outstanding balance of {$99.00} by debit card and closed the account. Now six months later, we applied for a new mortgage and after 3 days and many hours of calling Capital One found out that the payment in XX/XX/XXXX did not go through because they had mistakenly tried to take it out of an old XXXX XXXX XXXX account that they had on file which was closed in XXXX. It was our XXXX XXXX account, where all of the most recent payments had been made from that they should have taken the payment from. Without ever receiving any notification by email, letter or phone call, that the payment did not go through or that there was still an outstanding balance, we were informed by our mortgage company that suddenly in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One started reporting our status as late. Even though they have record in their own files that it was closed in XX/XX/XXXX and that payment had been attempted. They then agreed to listen to the phone call to determine how the mistake had been made by the agent. After "" supposedly '' listening to the call they informed us that they decided that they would not remove the lates and refused to give us any details of the phone call or the reasons why. We could not have possibly verbally given them the account # for the XXXX account because we had not used that account for over 4 years. I say "" supposedly '' because they were unable to give us any details of the phone call and why they made that decision. This was clearly a mistake by the agent over the phone and we feel that it is unethical for them to ruin our credit report and prevent us from buying our dream home because of their error. Our payment history was perfect up until we closed this account and we still have a different Capital One Venture card which also has perfect payment history. In fact, on the same day, we closed a XXXX Capital One card which was also showing up as late XX/XX/XXXX, which upon further review in the last few days, they realized that it had not been late, was paid on time and then closed, so they agreed to remove that incorrect late status within 24 hours. The last agent I spoke with, was rude and cold and just kept repeating the same thing, that even though he did not know "" why '', they "" have concluded that is was not their fault and that they would not be removing the lates. '' To be treated so badly by a company that we have paid thousands of dollars to over the years is outrageous. Regardless of whether or not they admit their mistake and take responsibility for it, all agree that there was a mistake and confusion of some kind in regard to payment attempted in XX/XX/XXXX and shows "" closed ''. This agent said he was the "" top guy '' and this his boss did not speak to customers. And basically had an attitude of disrespect and blatantly did not care about the situation and the fact that his company, through no fault of our own, has negatively impacted our financial situation and has kept us from being able to finance and buy our dream home. This is unjust that they should have so much power over our financial future. This hardship that they have caused is devastating and will affect our lives negatively for years to come. It seems to me that they should have some legal obligation to contact a person who tried to make a payment and close account before they begin to report to the credit bureau.

Your company response in XXXX XXXX specifically reflects her request of a dispute received. My client sent you another letter informing you that she could n't locate any information supporting this debt with any documentation she had around the same time.

Second example of misleading the consumer is the support documentation attached to the CFPB case was totally different than the letter received. This type of behavior puts consumers into a position in which attempts to portray them into paying debt. However in reality they have a valid dispute. 
Third example of misleading the consumer is the validation of debt in which is being used.

I use this card on rare occasions so a monthly statement is n't something that I expect to see. When I received a statement in XXXX of 2016, like other months and statements, I paid the balance in full. I have spoken to Capital One to try and resolve this miscommunication, however, they have told me to, "" Take it up with the credit bureaus because they sent statements and we do n't believe in reversing or removing anything that we have already submitted. And although we completely understand how this has hurt your credit, we do n't have any type of grace program that allows us to remove any late payment notifications. You can write a letter our Credit Bureau department if you still disagree with us. '' Yesterday, I noticed one of the bureaus removed the negative merit from my record. After talking to the XXXX of the credit bureaus, they advised me to contact Capital One to try understand why the negative merit was removed from one of the bureaus records, but remained on the other XXXX. Again, I was told by Capital One, "" We have nothing to do with that. If you have an issue, please write a letter to our Credit Bureau department. '' I have now been trying to resolve this issue for over 3 weeks and have spent more hours than I can keep track of. Capital One 's unwillingness to work with their customers to resolve a simple miscommunication shows me that their policies and procedures are skewed to ensure they protect themselves and hurt their customers.

123400,123400,123400,Bank account or service,Problems caused by my funds being low,"Dear Sir or Madam, I 've been on vacation with no access to a Capital One Bank branch in the area and I 've been hit with numerous overdraft fees ( XXXX in all )! And the number continues to climb each day. This is a total of {$330.00} which I find quite excessive. 

Unfortunately, I 've been unable to deposit any money into my account to stanch the flow of overdraft fees as I 've been in an area where there are no Capital One branches. 

I tried resolving this issue by contacting XXXX XXXX, Director of Complaint Operations for Capital One and she answered that she would have a colleague reach me to discuss the issue. When I received a call from her colleague it was only to explain to me why they were justified in charging me all of these fees. 

So I appeal to you for help. 

Capital One Bank 's have increasingly used overdraft "" protection '' plans in a way that is deceptive and unfair to consumers. The vast majority of large banks enroll consumers automatically in overdraft plans, charge an average of {$35.00} per overdraft, and manipulate the order transactions to post in a way that maximizes overdraft. This predatory practice must end! 

A report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) released in XXXX 2014 raises concerns about the impact of opting into overdraft services for debit card and ATM transactions. The study found that majority of debit card overdraft fees are incurred on transactions of {$24.00} or less, and that the majority of overdrafts are repaid within three days. Put in lending terms, if a consumer borrowed {$24.00} for three days and paid the median overdraft fee of {$34.00}, such a loan would carry a XXXX percent annual percentage rate ( APR ). 

By capping the number of overdraft fees Capital One Bank can charge, we will maximize protections to consumers. Unchecked, banks like Capital One will continue to XXXX their customer 's accounts with impunity. When will this end? 
Capital One 's predatory banking practices remind me of what XXXX XXXX says in her book How the Other Half Banks : "" One of the great ironies in modern America is that the less money you have, the more you pay to use it. The American banking industry has stopped serving those who are too poor to bank. '' Charging excessive overdraft fees on one 's account is wrong and should be stopped.",Capital One,NY,-0.0759285714286

I knew I did n't have overdraft protection with my Capital One 360 so it should just decline the transaction since there would be insufficient funds. But I do n't trust banks and wanted to double check. It was true that I was n't enrolled in your standard overdraft protection, but to my surprise I was enrolled in something called an 'overdraft line of credit ' with an 11.50 % interest rate. I never signed up for this nor was ever even given any information about it or any notice that this was an active part of my account. Fortunately I was able to turn that off before the banks opened today but I have a feeling this violates the requirement for the bank to get me to authorize overdraft protection. Either that or the bank is having fun with the language of the consumer protection laws and sees this as a way to auto-enroll members into overdraft protection by calling it something else, and likely making more money off of the 11.50 % interest than they ever would have through traditional overdraft fees.",Capital One,MO,0.163919413919

I believe that there is no security for the customers money in this bank or any other bank that conducts buisness in this manner, there needs to be a change to bank policy across the board to safe guard the rights of the customer. 

These type of security problems can be avoided simply by enforcing customer security over customer want, i rather wait 3-5 days for my funds to be checked out fully before any money is put into my account so i dont have to go through this ever again or any body else. 

It is the banks job to make sure a check is fully good and cleared before any funds are available, instead i was turned in circles and spoken to in a bad manner by a number of capital one representives and capital one rather blame me and lie to the better buisness bureau and all related agentcies than take responsibility to reimburse me for their faulty buisness policies. 

There should be no funds put into an account until a check is fully cleared and verified, this is the banks job to secure the money and transactions of the customer first not leave their customers broke and cut off of any money to live. 

I don, t accept this answer from capital one because they are just trying to cover up for there mistakes in policy, besides i had one of their higher ups call me and tell me that they are going to change policy across all of their banks because of this incident.

The salesman, the Dealership and Finance company all collectively refused to make the necessary corrects to the paperwork. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, with no viable or amicable alternative, I returned the car to the Dealership, located at : XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. 
I am asking that the Car I am driving from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Dealership want sell the car or Repo the Car until a Decision has been made in this case.

Upon information and belief, through further investigation and discovery, I believes that there may be a routine pattern and practice of false misrepresentation on the part of the dealing toward other senior citizens and veterans customers. I would appreciate if CFPB to take a serious look at this matter. 
I was quoted $ XXXX monthly car note at 29 %, by XXXX salesman XXXX XXXX XXXX, which would fit within my fixed XXXX Veteran monthly allowance from the VA. However, when the sales documen arrived from the Finance company ( Capital One Finance ) company, for the Rogue vehicle, the monthly note was : {$600.00}. The Salesman and Dealership, once again, just as the first purchase transaction, without my knowledge and without full disclosure to me, referred this transaction for Financing to none other than, the same Capital One Auto Finance. 
Moreover, to add insult to injury, the same Salesman, XXXX issued State required ( Gap Insurance ) at the time of the sales transaction. ( 10 days ) later the same Salesman XXXX XXXX contacted me requesting that I come to the Dealership. Upon arrival at the Dealership he revoked the State Regulatory requirements issued with the purchase of a vehicle. He then proceeded to tear up the original sales contract and the ( Gap Insurance ) policy. In violation of State regulatory requirements. The Salesman then re-issued a New Sales Purchase contract for the citing, instead that I must obtain Insurance for the car from another Insurance company. Therefore, I remain without ( Gap Insurance ) on the Rogue vehicle. When I subsequently reported the matter to the Capital One Finance company, the Capital One Finance, Agent stated that the actions taken by the Salesman ( XXXX XXXX was illegal and said that the Resolution Dept. Of Capital One Finance company will launch an investigation of the matter, which they did not do.

125786,125786,125786,Credit card,Closing/Cancelling account,"Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have maintained an account with Capital One with whom I have XXXX credit cards. I have had no returned payments in that time. 

I recently moved to New York and opened a XXXX account as XXXX does not have any branches in New York. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I attempted to put my new bank account information into Capital One 's website, intending to pay the full balance of {$2400.00}. Using the bottom of a check, I entered the routing number and account number. The account information was "" verified '' ( that is, it accepted it input ) and I submitted the payment. I was given a confirmation number accepting the payment. I received emails that my account was "" linked '' and that my payment was scheduled. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received emails that my payment had been returned by XXXX because of an "" invalid account number ''. I was on my way to school and did n't have time to deal with the issue just then but that afternoon I attempted to speak with both XXXX and Capital One regarding the payment return and the invalid account number. I noticed also that my account had been closed. 

After over 4 hours on the phone, I ascertained from XXXX ( on a three-way call that included a representative from Capital One ) that I had the proper account number and routing number. Frustratingly, neither XXXX nor Capital One were willing or able to tell me the exact nature of the error. 

XXXX refused to provide me with any documentation of a requested and returned payment. They repeatedly accessed my account and informed me that no payment was made and so they had no record of a returned payment. I attempted to inform them that naturally there would be reflected in my account no returned payment as the payment was requested from an invalid account number. They did not seem to understand this and when I requested to speak with someone in an accounting or compliance role who might have a record of a returned payment, they refused to connect me. 

Capital One was only slightly more helpful. They requested documentation from XXXX of the returned payment ( see the previous paragraph ), stating that absent documentation of bank error or fraud, they could not reinstate my account. I spoke with an account manager, XXXX, around XXXX who told me that she was escalating my complaint to a review committee who would make a determination about whether or not my account could be reinstated and that I could expect to hear from them the week of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did not hear from them in that time period. 

During that time, I realized that I had probably mistakenly mistyped my account number on Capital One 's website adding, directly from the bottom of my checkbook, a "" XXXX '' to the beginning. I am not certain of this as I have not been given documentation of my error. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I called Capital One re. the status of my request. I told them that I had probably mistakenly mistyped my account number. I was connected with an account manager who said that the review committee had declined to reopen my account, that they had adopted a strict rule re. returned payments and that a returned payment, regardless of one 's payment history or the circumstances of the return, would result in permanent account closure. I was told that all decisions were final, that the review committee did not hear further appeals, that I would be given no documentation of the decision and that I was ineligible to ever apply for another card. 

I am concerned that I have had my account closed a ) without documentation of exactly what went wrong, b ) without opportunity to correct the mistake before account closure, c ) without a meaningful opportunity to appeal closure, d ) without consideration of the nature of the returned payment, and e ) in a way that negatively affects my credit and, as a future attorney, has consequences re. my prospects of bar admission.",Capital One,NY,0.0475108225108

She explained that despite the account having regular manual payments made, multiple times a month. The account was being closed due to a couple of automatic payments being returned and the account would be closed. To date I have not been late for a single payment nor have I exceeded my credit limit since opening the account and it has been in excellent standing. I explained that the automatic payments had not gone through because I had not updated my bank settings after changing banks recently and had been making manual payments, this was the reason for the returned automated payments. 

Throughout the conversation I asked her if this was a permanent decision and would she be able to re-open the account given that payments had always been made, and covered minimum monthly payments adequately. She was unable to offer any assistance and was rude throughout the conversation telling me she was not a credit advisor and could not help my situation - quite patronizing to say the least. When I then went on to ask exactly how the "" closed account '' decision would be passed on to my credit agencies, she was unable to tell me the classification that Capital One would give for the closure.

While completing the application on the CapitalOne website, I noticed that it did not specify what type of card I was applying for, so I clicked on the CapitalOne "" CHAT '' link. I asked the CaptitalOne agent what type of card this application was for and he/she replied "" XXXX, '' so I completed and submitted my application on-line.

I responded "" then why did n't your agent let me know this before I applied? '' Their response was basically that the chat agent had no way of knowing that I had been directed to their site via a 3rd party 's site. They refused to issue me a XXXX card and told me I could cancel the MASTECARD ( which I have now done ) but that I was now blocked from applying for a XXXX card from CapitalOne for six months. 
The reason I received a XXXX is either because of a direct lie by their agent ( which I doubt was the case ) or because of a shortcoming in CapitalOne 's website in that their Chat agent should have had the information that I had been directed to their site via a third party so he/she could have answered my question accurately. I made no errors or omissions in the process.

129129,129129,129129,Mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","This follows from case # XXXX, submitted and reviewed by Capital One with partial remediation. I am filing this complaint as an extension of # XXXX, for while the issue that originated the complaint was partially addressed with the return of my closing costs, the outstanding issue of the monthly mortgage payment owing to the mistake Capital One acknowledged in their correspondence to me remains. 

# XXXX deals with the fact that my escrow account was underfunded owing to the fact that Capital One "" accidentally '' did not collect city taxes for escrow. I dispute this claim, for the mortgage vetting process is extensive and highly reviewed, specially in recent years. Missing a standard piece of the process, e.g. one of the taxes to collect for escrow, is almost incomprehensible. The documents are reviewed so many times, as I have seen both as a consumer and participation in mortgage origination, that actually missing this detail would be sufficient for federal penalty. Following Capital One acknowledging this "" error '', I was refunded my closing costs. 

A second practice ensued. I was immediately enrolled in an option to spread the payments of the remaining escrow balance over 60 months. Had I not paid attention to this item and paid off the escrow with the money returned to me by Capital One, I would have actually paid out roughly {$4000.00} over the life of this arrangement beyond the actual value of the escrow amount. This is an issue that I believe deserves federal review, as it attempts to make money off the consumer while seeming to help. This is especially onerous, given that fault was acknowledged, and Capital One still attempted to make money off of me. I called the escrow office, and I avoided this trap by paying the escrow. I was told by the representative that this would drop my payment back down, as I had effectively pre-funded the account. 

I called back the Office of the President, specifically XXXX XXXX, the original representative who contacted me, when I discovered that my monthly payment had in fact not gone down. I was told that it would not reduce. When I complained that this means the original problem still remains, given that I was now paying at least {$50.00} / month extra for the life of the loan, more than the final amount given to me at the point of closing the loan, she told me she would escalate the issue. 

My complaint now stands that I was offered a load with an artifically low amount per month to "" close the deal '' at closing, and once my business was ensured by contract, Capital One now refuses to respond to the full complaint, relying upon my fatigue in attempting to deal with this issue while it is "" escalated ''. I will include sample notes of one attempt at communciation on this subject demonstrating how Capital One has continued to provide no details and any contact I have had from Capital One has mysteriously come at the very end of the day, and once I call back, people are either almost immediately "" out of the office '' or in once case "" on vacation ''. This last experience was particularlly odd, given that the individual in question asked me on a Friday to call the following Monday, but she was then out all week. When I attempted to contact a person referenced on her voicemail as being able to help, he consistently contacted me at the close of the day, and I never was able to talk to him, even when I called back at times given by him on which to communicate. 

A final note : I was told in calling back after not being able to talk to anyone, asking if I can talk to the complaint department. I was told "" you can not make a complaint, because it is being reviewed above the complaint department ''. Effectively, Capital One has adopted a policy of continued "" escalation '' to avoid remediation or larger review.",Capital One,TN,0.0339191919192

I also never had any misuse or fraud on the cards. The next day when I called back to find out where do I submit my ID & SS card, I was told I needed to provide an ID and SS card for every person who I ever had on my account as an authorized user.

The reason I am complaining is because I have reached out to Capital One regarding this twice and encountered long hold times and reached no one who knew how to resolve the issue. Capital One was supposed to give me a call back regarding the matter, as no one accepting inbound calls could assist me. No call back. Capital One did not take my notification of identity theft seriously, they did not disable the 360 bank account that the thief set up. They did not disable the user ID XXXX. Now I have no access to make payments to my new credit card online because they are catering to the identity thief and refuse to help me. 

Since I can not get through to Capital One by calling, I am making this complaint and hoping that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can help me to get the protection I need. I hope that online access through user ID XXXX that the thief has to my Capital One credit card and to the bank account which I did not set up can be disabled. 

I have been through the worst experience of my life and knowing that Capital One will not even speak to me regarding this matter is disheartening. By having access to my accounts, this identity thief can compromise this new credit card.",Capital One,VA,-0.175623885918

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM I have not had a credit card account with Capital One since my last active account expired in XXXX, but I do occasionally receive promotional emails from them that I automatically delete. Today, however, I opened an email from Capital One and was surprised to see a bill for a total of {$130.00}, an original charge of {$48.00} plus {$83.00} in late fees. At first I thought it was a very old bill, as the original charge was from a merchant with whom I had closed an account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but then I saw that the date of the charge was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I contacted the merchant, XXXX, and explained to the customer service representative that I had closed the account with XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, prior to the charge. She looked into my account records and saw that I had indeed closed my XXXX account before I was charged. She apologized for the error ( and explained that sometimes there is a lag time ) that she would have the amount charged to Capital One refunded to me. After a brief time on hold, the customer service representative from XXXX stated that she could not refund the charge to my credit card because the Capital One card they had on file for me had expired in XXXX, so she would have to mail me a refund check instead. She also said that the {$48.00}. SHOULD have been declined since the Capital One credit card had expired two years ago. Please see the attached email that I received from XXXX describing the erroneous charge to the expired Capital One card and reason for the refund. 

I immediately contacted Capital One and explained to them that I have not had an account with them since my last credit card with them expired in XXXX, and that the merchant was refunding the original charge by mail because the credit card account no longer existed, and that I expected the late fees to be removed since a closed account should not be able to be charged. The Capital One representative said that closed/expired accounts "" are sometimes charged '' accidentally and I was still accountable for the late fees. When I explained that the credit card that was recently charged had expired two years ago and that I have not had an active account with Capital One for two years, her response was, "" Well, sometimes that happens [ expired accounts are charged ] '', and that it does not matter if the account has been expired for years when it was charged, that I still owed the money. 

When I first I asked the Capital One representative if I could speak with a supervisor, and she became angry and just repeated that it does n't matter how many years my account has been expired, "" sometimes it happens '' and that I "" owed the money '' even if the original merchant recognized the error. The second time I asked to speak to a supervisor, there was a silence, then a dial tone, and it seemed very obvious to me that she had hung up on me. This made me very scared that I would not be able to trust any of my direct interactions with Capital One, so I contacted the CFPB immediately. 

I know that late fees can have a devastating effect on my otherwise "" Very Good '' to "" Excellent '' credit score, so I am very afraid that Capital One will try to do as much damage to my credit score as possible, based on the hostility I have confronted with the customer service so far.

For years I would pay my payments until one day I decided that I wanted to pay off my balance and close the account. About 5 years ago I called Capitol One and paid them in full. I then asked to close the account and thought that it was closed. 30 days after paying my balance in full I come to find out that my card was still open and there was a {$30.00} balance on my card. I asked them why there was a balance on my card and why they kept charging me and I was told that there was recurring payments on the card. I informed them that there should be no recurring charges since my card was closed. I even offered to pay the additional charge to bring my balance down to {$0.00} just so I can close my card and prevent any more charges from being placed. They told me that they could n't close the card because of the recurring charges .... 

Since I had no luck with a normal Capitol One representative, I then spoke to a supervisor and wanted to know why they were keeping the card open. Essentially I was told the same thing by the supervisor that the representative told me. I argued that there should be no recurring charges since the card was closed and I argued that regardless of anything going on with any creditors I should be allowed to close down my own card. The supervisor refused.I again disputed the charge and demanded that my card be shut down and that was the last I spoke with anyone at Capitol One. 

Ever since that day I have refused to use credit because of the terrible experience I had with Capitol One. Unfortunately, I no longer have that luxury. 5 years later I check my credit report so I can buy a home and I find out that there is a Capitol One charge off with an {$890.00} balance! Furthermore, it has been sold to a collection agency and so now it 's reporting on my credit report twice! 

I 'm no expert in laws and practices but I 'm sure there is a law somewhere that says a credit card company ca n't refuse to shut down a credit card and and allow recurring charges to pile up simply because they feel like it. How can a balance on a card that was paid off and supposed to be closed get to {$890.00} dollars! That is both malicious and fraudulent! 

Here I am now 5 years later and I find out I ca n't qualify for a home unless I pay this account off. On top of that, even if I do pay it off my credit score will still be damaged because that wo n't remove the erroneous charge off or collection from my credit report therefore I am getting double screwed here!

She confirmed that the account was flagged as possible fraud, that their records showed all my phone calls were noted, and even that the last agent confirmed in his notes that the account would be closed, and it was NOT. She confirmed very honestly that the proper procedures were not followed and it was an error on their part. Fine, but now I have had a fraudulent account open in my name, affecting my credit score for 2+ months when it should have never shown up in the first place! Capital One should be put out of business. MY TIP : If you receive any letters indicating possible fraud, call immediately and ask to speak with fraud supervisor. Also get their name, employee ID and confirmation that a letter stating the closure of the account will be sent to you.",Capital One,CA,0.153020833333
133551,133551,133551,Credit card,APR or interest rate,"I have a current credit card from Capital One that the terms have been routinely changed on multiple times since it 's original issuance to me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have formally requested the original card-holder agreement and terms that were issued from the original XXXX/XXXX/XXXX issue date and Capital One has neglected to provide it to me. They only seem willing to provide me with XXXX from XXXX XXXX that accompanied a new change in agreement/term that I was not properly notified about again. 
The reason that I would like the original agreement is because I remember being offered a much better long term interest rate than what has appeared through the last 3 years of statements that I have received and now reviewed online. I believe that Capital One has not adhered to their original issuer agreement with me and has adjusted their rates upwards at a regular interval over the last 3 years to a nearly 24 % purchase rate. The original rate was supposed to be 14.9 % for 2 years, but I do n't see any indication on my statements of a fixed purchase rate over this period of time. 
Capital One also does not have a single late payment from me as I have had automatic payment established with them from the inception of the account which I have adjusted to pay at least double the minimum monthly payment. I usually follow-up with a XXXX payment each month of much more. 
I have a printed record of my latest request for the original XXXX/XXXX/XXXX card issuance agreement by Capital One 's secure online chat service from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. "" XXXX '' was told by myself that I specifically wanted to check on this agreement as I felt that I was duped on the terms and charged much more money. He told me that he had found the original agreement and would send it to me by mail. I told him that I did not want the current agreement for XXXX XXXX in which the terms had once again changed. He told me that he understood that and would send the original XXXX/XXXX/XXXX agreement. 
I received the XXXX XXXX Agreement in the mail yesterday. I think that Capital One is avoiding providing me with the original card issuance Agreement because they have defrauded me of its terms and do n't want me to be able to prove it. 
I demand to be given this original agreement as I am entitled to it as a card member and suspect fraud has gone on against my account for the last 3 years over my APR interest purchase rate as well as the introductory 0 % that I should have received for longer than was applied to my account.

The other person divulged my account information without hesitation. My husband explained that he had already been given my account information and explained what we had been told about the law in Maine regarding spouses.

XXXX was extremely rude and abrasive and was not helpful in any way. XXXX explained that she could not give my husband any information regarding my account due to him not being listed as a user on the account then after divulging some of my information including account numbers and balances she stated to my husband that the reason she could not discuss any information with him was due to the attorney listed on the account.

XXXX is addressing statements in this letter with the presentation of the following urgent information and report, Safe Call ( see below ) : Over XXXX people were killed in automobile accidents last year, and another XXXX were seriously injured! The automobile is the number one cause of harm and death to young people and students! 

The NHTSA states, "" distracted driving is the number one cause of auto accidents and a deadly epidemic! '' XXXX has the cure for this deadly epidemic ... Eyes on the Road/Hands on the Wheel ... the science of road concentration! Once this message is realized by the driving public the next step is distraction prevention. 
There are XXXX mobile phone users and over a XXXX vehicles, so mobile phone use while driving is a worldwide constant and this fact must be reckoned with. 

Banks are the most called business in the world, and also the business most likely to have the dangerous request, "" enter your ATM card number. '' This request is extremely hazardous to those on the road as it is encouraging people to text message or read ATM card information while driving! Furthermore this telephone banking practice is rendered obsolete with the realization that ATM cards are no longer effective as modern security as they can be lost, stolen, or even secretly copied, and there are modern and better securities protocols now available such as secret passwords and user names. 

Since several banks such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Capital One have acknowledged the importance of the XXXX recommendations for voice command on their main telephone banking line by using them, XXXX now proposes that these same innovations be applied to all banking divisions, such as credit card, mortgage, brokerage, and loan departments. 

The XXXX Safe Call recommendations improve banking security, safety, proficiency, and customer satisfaction, and cost little to implement. There are no legitimate arguments to oppose these urgent telecommunication advancements and improvements Again : ATM CARDS UNSAFE FOR IDENTIFICATION AND SECURITY! 

ATM card identification requests encourage text messaging, and card reading while driving! 

ATM cards are obsolete and ineffective for security and should be replaced by modern identification security.

They flatly told me that even though it was wrong to see my business credit card info on my personal credit report, that they will not remove it. l was told that it was their company policy to report business on personal whether the law allows them or not. 
Over the past 3-5 days since XXXX .

XXXX insisted that there is absolutely nothing they can do and having been told that before in the past, no matter how long l called to insist on my argument, that they will not budge.

136397,136397,136397,Credit card,Billing statement,"Dear Sir or Madam : I am seeking your help to enforce Sec. 163 of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. I suffered monetary loss of {$96000.00} in higher interest payments that will occur over the life of my home mortgage from incorrect information reported by Kohl 's to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I have disputed this information multiple times with Kohl 's, XXXX, and XXXX. While Kohl 's could not provide any evidence to prove that the information is correct, Kohl 's continue claiming that the information is correct. 

Kohl 's reported XXXX late payments to credit reporting agencies as shown in XXXX. XXXX : The late payment reported in XXXX XXXX. 
The late payment reported in XXXX XXXX. 

The late payments were inaccurate because Kohl 's does not have reasonable procedures in place to ensure that each periodic statement is delivered to me no later than 21 days before the payment due date. 

Kohl 's e-statement delivery system had not sent me any emails for billing statements in XXXX and XXXX. Though during the same period, I had received marketing emails from Kohl 's and Class Action Settlement emails. I had reported this problem to Customer Service and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX ) and asked Kohl 's to send test emails ; however, Kohl 's did not have any reasonable procedures in place to resolve the problem. In a phone conversation with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX said that I could have checked the balance online, called Customer Service or gone to the store, and she made no attempt to check Kohl 's system. In another phone conversation with XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I informed her that XXXX XXXX XXXX had not sent me e-statements either but fixed the problem after I reported the problem to customer service. I also told her that I had received complaints from my company 's customers regarding not receiving e-statements as well. After diligent investigation, we found out that our company 's new system did not send e-mail notification to customers automatically when a billing statement was created. However, XXXX XXXX still did not conduct any investigation even though she did not have any evidence of sent emails. She closed the case based on that statements were created ( XXXX. XXXX ) and never responded to my requests for evidence of sent emails ( XXXX. XXXX ). 

In addition to problems with e-statements deliveries, Kohl 's also had problem with its automated calling system which I also reported to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX ). From XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Kohl 's made 23 failed calls. I answered XXXX calls from XXXX but nobody was on the caller side. I received 19 voicemails from XXXX but the voicemails were only 1-2 seconds long and no messages were left. From XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received 11 voicemails from XXXX and XXXX but again the voicemails were only 1-2 seconds long and no messages were left. Even though Kohl 's automated calling system failed, Kohl 's still did not check its e-statement delivery system. In a phone conversation with XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX said Kohl 's is not required to call me about the payment due. However, she could n't answer what Kohl 's procedures are in the event that its e-statement delivery system fails. 

There is an unfair information and resource imbalance between Kohl 's and consumers. Thus Kohl 's needs to have a high level of standard when providing negative information that damages a consumer 's credit score. Based on the unreliable e-statement delivery and automatic calling system, and lack of reasonable procedures in place to resolve customers ' complaints, I believe that they have not met the standard required by the law. Please see Exhibit XXXX for other consumers who have complaints against Kohl 's for the same issues.",Capital One,CA,-0.0831951871658

139072,139072,139072,Credit card,Delinquent account,"This complaint is against Capital One Credit Card negative account in my credit report. This negative account is hurting my credit, but makes a false claim. I do not owe Capital One any monies : Capital One was the first to brake the terms of the credit card agreement. In fact, Capital One has already taken this claim to court and the case was dismissed. Capital One claim is just wrong. 

Capital One broke the terms of the credit card when they deny my right to dispute a charge in my account. In 2010, I moved and was scamed by the moving company shiiping my stuff : in order to deliver my stuff, the merchant demanded a cash payment, when I had already paid for all merchant 's services with my credit card. Consequently, I disputed merchant 's charge on my Capital One credit card. However, Capital One denied my right, per the card 's terms and conditions, to dispute the charge. 

In order to deny my right to dispute the moving company 's charge, Capital One requested additional information ( which I had already provided in previous corresondence ) and only allowed me 24 hours to submit it, else Capital One would close the dispute. Capital One requested additional documents in a letter dated XXXX XXXX 2010. The letter was delivered on XXXX XXXX 2010 and it required the supporting documents to be received by XXXX XXXX 2010. Since I was out of the country ( as Capital One could have guessed from the charges in my credit card ), I did not find out about the 24 hours deadline to provide supporting documents, until it had expired. I was still able to submit the requested document within a week. However, Capital One disregarded my submission and closed the case. I filed a complaint argueing it was not reasonable I was only given 24 hours to reply Capital One 's request. I wanted Capital One to continue my dispute against the moving company. Capital One gave the excuse the time XXXX allows them to process the dispute was very short and to meet that timeframe they could only allow me 24 hours to reply their request for supporting material. This was all a lie by Capital one. I called XXXX and was told they do not set time limits to process disputes. in any case, I had filed my dispute less than 3 months after the credit card charge and my submission of suporting documents was less than 5 months after the credit card charge. Nevertheless, Capital One insisted to close the dispute, removed the temporary credit I had received and demanded I pay that charge. Since I considered Capital One had not respected my rights and had broken the terms of the credit card, by denying my right to dispute a charge, I informed Capital One I was not going to pay that charge and was not going to use my credit card ever again. Capital One very quickly added late fees and finance charges, until the balance reached around {$1500.00} and they charged the account off. 

Capital One continued demanding I pay the card 's balance in full. but I never agreed to Capital One 's claims. Eventually, Capital One realized that and decided to take its claim to court : the case was dismissed. So should now this negative account from my credit report, since Capital One 's claim is wrong. 

As a side note not relevant to this credit report dispute, I need to say it is really unfortunate, Capital One Dispute Department is the worst from all credit card companies I have ever dealt with. I had already had previous experiences where Capital One Dispute Department was very incompetent and unhelpful. I liked my Capital One credit card. It had good conditions and I used to use it a lot. I was a good client and was never late in my payments. However, I had to give it up as I found unacceptable Capital One would let me down : they denied my right to dispute an incorrect charge and so allowed some merchant to scam me.",Capital One,MT,-0.0229837490552

For any debt by a lending institution, you can not send me the information that I do in fact owe you. You ca n't send it to me because you do n't have it, okay? I got some bill in the mail, and there is something on my credit report. That 's kind of like a bill because it 's saying on my credit report there 's this derogatory account.

I 'm 3 months late, which is no more than {$1000.00} past due including fees. 

The repo agent came to the door and I asked him if he had a replevin order. He said a writ of possession will be filed very soon and then he left. He also told me that the past due was {$1900.00} in range. I then called Capital One Auto. 

I was told that by their agent named XXXX that I was past due {$1400.00} at the time of the call and that it was scheduled to charge off that day, XXXX XXXX, by XXXX. I told her I had just started working and could make my payment in 3weeks. She said no, it will charge off by XXXX that day. She also said that XXXX XXXX said I told them they 'd have to go legal. I never said that. I asked if it was already legal, but after three months only -- I assumed it was not. 

I did n't have the money one week later, but another rep told me that it was not about to charge off at XXXX that day. And that the first rep had deceived me. 

Today, they continue. I received an odd vmail from what I believe is the repo company requesting I call back. I 've never called that number and do n't know any XXXX. I also received a call from Capital One on my vmail stating that the loan was charged ( the word "" off '' missing ) and that they were moving forward ( after only 90 days ).

When I spoke to a new credit card product agent, the offers that were provided to me, did not match the previous benefits of my accounts that were closed. XXXX told me that CapitalOne is completely within their rights as stated in my customer agreement, to have closed my accounts in this fashion. What I do n't understand, is that I 've had both of these cards for very lengthy periods of time, I have not used them recently in any manner that I have not used them in the past. In other words, there is no current or recent activity, that is any different from the activity over the past 9 years or 6 years. My credit card ending in XXXX ( the card opened in XX/XX/XXXX ), I have used for balance transfers, for 9 years, so there is no activity now that does not match previous activity.

The day after XXXX, 2016, they called us at XXXX stating how sorry they were and that the issue would be fixed immediately. They never fixed it. So we called again, on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 and they said there were no notes on the account stating that the payment had gone through. They said we were lying, in essence. They ended up conceding and saying they would investigate it again. We have been waiting almost 2 months for this now and we have now had XXXX reports of the credit card being late and closed with a large balance of {$700.00}. If they had applied our payments that cleared our bank and was confirmed by our bank that it cleared, then the balance would be down to around {$280.00}. They also offered us a {$75.00} courtesy credit for our trouble and that was never applied either. Now they are claiming they never said or did any of this!!! We have spent hours and hours on the phone with them, fighting them on this. We do n't know what else to do.

A few days after I made my last call to Capital One, and after they failed to return my calls after XXXX separate requests which forced my hand to file my complaints with the state of XXXX and XXXX offices of the attorney general - Capital One sent yet another letter to the address in XXXX, which I requested and demanded they remove from my account two weeks and XXXX calls earlier and had informed them on XXXX previous calls that I currently had a credit card open with Capital One which had a present address in XXXX. This last letter indicated to the individual at the address in XXXX that attempted to open the account in my name, to please contact Capital One as the account was temporarily on hold and they needed to speak to the card holder prior to moving forward with activating the card.

143091,143091,143091,Credit card,Late fee,"I recently applied for a Cap One card- because I wanted to establish a form of credit, to begin a successful record to reflect responsibility from a consumer/customer. I received the card, after paying {$50.00} for it, w/an available balance of {$200.00}. I charged up the {$200.00} and looked forward to paying my monthly fee, going forward. I paid my first payment online on XXXX/XXXX/16. At the same time, I signed up for auto pay, to make electronic payments for the min amount, easier than remembering to pay each month. However, on XXXX/XXXX/16, I sat around waiting for the auto payment to be deducted. I checked online, I checked the app ... on XXXX XXXX, I saw that I was charged a late fee for non payment. I immediately called the company. I called to close the account completely & I was prepared to pay off the whole balance, as I was upset that this occurred. I explained to the CSR that I was signed up for auto payment, and that there should have been a payment deducted from my account, that would avoid any late fee. I explained to the rep. That I had no desire to be in credit card late payment trouble & debt over a {$200.00} credit card & it simply was n't worth it. I explained that I 'd go ahead, pay the balance to close the account. I requested my {$50.00} refundable deposit. I expressed to him my disappointment in having to deal with these issues, a month into owing a card that I only applied for, to help me instead of hurt me more. The rep then explained to me that it would not reflect negatively on my credit report, and that one late fee does n't usually cause your credit to take a dive. He expressed that he would refund the {$25.00} late fee, accept my payment over the phone & personally get me signed up for auto payment, so that I would never have this problem again. I accepted his offer to waive the fee, as well as to sign me up, based on his confident promise, that by him personally signing me up ; I 'd never ever have this problem. He assured me & promised me over and over on the phone that if I kept the account, he was personally making it right- and then he went through the steps to sign me up. After-which, he guaranteed me again, by reading the disclosures, verifying/confirming information regarding what I wanted to pay each month {$25.00}. He confirmed the actual dates that it would be deducted XXXX of each month. 
Before he closed the call, he reminded me that on XXXX ; my first auto payment of XXXX $ would be deducted from my XXXX Bank account. He stated one final time that I was signed up, all was clear and that an auto payment going forward would be effective immediately, and he added that he 's already refunded the late fee.

Upset that I 'd gone through all that in XXXX, only to turn around and go through it again ; I explained the entire case to the new CSR. This time, the agent refused to accept the amount that I actually owed, unless I consent to paying the late fee and wait on my reimbursement. When I refused to pay an additional XXXX $ for their error, on top of what I agreed to pay, the company immediately placed it on my credit report within 24 hours.

Capital One has based this decision on a fake email "" bill '' submitted to them by the Merchant in spite of clear proof that I have furnished to them that the charges are not legitimate. 

I paid a Merchant ( horse trainer ) {$1500.00} for services ( Full Training ) of my horse. The "" Full Training '' includes the pick and and drop off of my horse, training the horse, grooming, one feeding of grain per day, housing and feeding the horse ( board ). These services are typically included in "" full training ''. The services were billed at one month for {$1500.00} and two additional days at {$96.00}. 

The horse trainer refused to provide the services ( they said they did not want to train my horse anymore ) after six days and returned the horse to me the following day. This was after I asked them why my horse was acting like he was extremely frightened and had regressed in his training while being in their care. Instead of telling me what had happened to my horse, the horse trainer told me in a voice mail, which I still have, that they did not want to train my horse. They also said in that same voice mail message, that they would "" drop off '' my horse the following day and they said that "" we are going to give you your money back ''. 

The Merchant ( horse trainer ) never issued me the credit back they had promised me for any of the {$1500.00} that I had paid for the month and two days even though he had only had my horse for six days. When I disputed the charge on my credit card, the horse trainer told me they would mail me a refund and I should just pay the credit card amount in full. Needless to say, I never received any refund in the mail from them. The horse trainer then made up false charges in an email which they forwarded to Capital One in an attempt to defraud me of my money and avoid giving me the credit back they owed me. The Merchant sent this fraudulent email "" bill '' to Capital One as their "" proof '' with nothing else to substantial that these were legitimate charges ( which they were not ) or that I had agreed to the charges ( which I had not ). This disreputable Merchant invented charges which totaled {$710.00} when they only had my horse for six days and claim they only trained him for four days!

143923,143923,143923,Bank account or service,Deposits and withdrawals,"Hi. 
I 've been getting the runaround by both Kohls and our bank regarding {$1800.00} that was improperly taken out of my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX through two separate transactions. Attached are the bank statements showing the withdrawals? In short, Kohls said that the problem is the bank 's because it 's a bank fraud issue. The bank said it 's Kohl 's problem because they submitted incorrect information and they need to reverse it. We do not have a Kohls credit card. We never had one either. 

Neither will help me. 

Also, the bank wo n't help me because they said we only have 60 days to dispute a charge. I pushed them about this asking if this was bank policy or law and they suggested it was bank policy, not law. Still, no one at the bank will do anything. 

I also explained the extenuating circumstances. I 'm going through a divorce. Me and my wife separated on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Yes, XXXX. ) I have n't lived at home since. The charges were just three weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX. Since we have a Kohl 's nearby, I assumed my wife bought new clothes for her and her dad. And since we just separated and emotions were high as a result, I did n't question the transaction. However, now that our divorce is proceeding, a few months ago we started looking at detail transactions. When this transaction was discussed, she said she did n't make this charge. I did n't either. So I looked into it and found out neither of us did. 

I 've spent many hours going back and forth to solve this, calling Kohl 's at least four times and the bank three times. Except to a fax I sent Kohls ( see attachment ), everything I have is verbal. 

If you look at the attached backup that the bank gave me, even though Kohls clearly made a mistake, in my less than legal opinion the bank is the one who really messed up. Aside from the bank account number, there is nothing on the attached ACH information that accurately identifies our account number with us. The name is incorrect. There is n't any matching address. No matching social security numbers. No matching birthdays. 

So it does n't appear to be a case of someone stealing my ID. 

To me, it 's insane that the bank would allow a charge to go through without verifying the account belongs to that person. Every time I call the bank or credit card company they always ask for verification, either social security number, birthday, password, a secret question ... something! There is nothing on the attached file which identifies that charge to us. 

You would think that the name alone not matching would have triggered a red flag! 

I pressed XXXX on this. I asked them if they verified that the account number that is provided is accurate before processing a charge. They dodged the question saying that it 's up to Kohls to provide proper information. And even so, they wo n't do anything about it because it 's over 60 days. They said that Kohls needs to submit a correction. 

But I spoke with a manager in Kohl 's credit card area and they were adamant that they wo n't do anything and that 's it 's a bank fraud issue. I did share this information with Kohls. So they know they submitted a bad name associated with our account. 

I feel helpless. My divorce attorney forwarded me to your organization and said they might listen to you. They are not listening to me at all. The amount is too small for an attorney to take on and, to be honest, I feel uncomfortable about going to small claims court. I called the CFP on XX/XX/XXXX and they suggested that I file my complaint in this section. 

I feel you are my last hope. 

Thank you in advance for your help.

I was quoted an interest rate through their auto navigator of 12.17 % to 19.31 % APR.

Going from an 8 % interest rate to 19.31 % is a pretty big jump.

Long story short, I contacted Capital One about this extortion attempt and of ALL my banks, online accounts, credit unions, etc. Capital One was the ONLY company who consistently GAVE OUT information. 

Let me clarify. I called Capital One on XX/XX/2016 and told them about the phone call for money and told them that I believe my account might have been hacked so I would like a new credit card number and to remove my online access completely. I asked also for additional security measures to be placed on my card, since the frauds knew my social, addresses, etc. I figured adding more security was essential to protect my credit and what private identity I had left. 

So, additional measures were placed and the card was sent BUT it took over 3 days, countless hours, 10+ phone calls to remove the online account. And worse, several representatives in the FRAUD department FAILED to ask me the additional security measures, and instead only asked for social/bday, which they knew was already compromised! Add to that, that one rep, XXXX in the FRAUD department even started to tell me my credit card number over the phone! If that 's not a security breach, I do n't know what is! 

Also, it took over 24 hours for the online account to be removed, whereas my other accounts understood the severity of my identity issue and resolved the issues immediately. It is 72 hours later and I call Capital One because my new card arrived and low and I call fraud department to activate the card. They tell me to verify my identity with my social, birthday but NOT additional security measures until I PROMPTED THEM! XXXX was one such rep and eventually said he would call back. Little did I know that I had my phone "" do not disturb '' on and when I called back to speak to XXXX, got the run around. I was eventually transferred to XXXX, who out of the blue decided arbitrarily to make me send in a myriad of personal information.

Critically the rate renewal process was done online, by simply checking a box and then speaking to an agent. Forms were then sent out just before new year as the final part of the process to confirm what had been discussed. 
Please see pages XXXX & XXXX of the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage documents I am sending you. 
The page titled "" Agreement to modify note '' was, I was told, to lower my rate for 5 more years. It was not pointed out or even discussed that the index that is used for future rate changes after the ARM expires was also changed. 
The original mortgage stated the index used was "" the weekly average yield on US treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 1 year, as made available by the Federal Reserve Board. '' ( see XXXX of the pdf ). 
The agreement to modify cites a different current rate of "" the One Year treasury bond ( XXXX ) '' changed to "" the one year LIBOR ''. 
One year Libor is a much higher rate than the weekly average yield on US treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 1 year. I am led to believe by over XXXX higher. This will significantly raise my mortgage payments as my 5 year ARM expires this month. 
I refinanced the XX/XX/XXXX ARM again in XX/XX/XXXX. Again online with a one month mortgage payment fee and with a similarly short modification note. This note only refers to "" the index '' without stating which index. 
Conclusion : 1. I was misled in XX/XX/XXXX. It was never verbally discussed that the reference rate was changing. I paid significant fees with a large capital pay down to be stuck with a higher index rate. All the initial refinance processing is done online and by phone. The modification documents are only sent out once agreement is reached. 
2. the index rate in the XX/XX/XXXX "" Agreement to modify '' is different from that stated in the original XX/XX/XXXX mortgage documents. 
XX/XX/XXXX documents state "" the One Year treasury bond '' versus the original documents state, "" the weekly average yield on US treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 1 year, as made available by the Federal Reserve Board. '' 3. the XX/XX/XXXX agreement to modify does not highlight what was a major change to the index rate used for my loan. This issue is also coupled with the error in point 2. above. 
I will be paying a much higher floating rate starting XX/XX/XXXX, due to this misleading change to the index rate used for my mortgage.",Capital One,CT,0.121526677929

When I spoke to the rep and asked whether my social security information had already been sold to third parties since my loan started 5 minths ago, he indicated yes that information has been sold. My question is "" is n't it illegal to sell people 's social security numbers ''? It increases fraud, and I do n't think companies should profit off of selling other 's confidential information without their consent. 

The rep said now that I contacted Capital One, they will stop selling my information for marketing purposes, but it 's too late. They aold my information to a third party, and now that third party will likely sell to another party. Capital One is in ore than the loan business. They are using it to take other 's confidential data and profit off it. Meanwhile, I have the concern of identity theft. I think there should be laws to punish companies that share people 's confidential data without consent. I would like to know where the CFPB stands on this issue and what are my options at this point? My info has already been shared with many I 'm sure.

In their recent discovery they sighted an error on their part and claim to have adjusted my account by a {$150.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and that at the time of the error my account should have been reinstated and monthly billing statements should have commenced. 

However, instead of reinstating my account for a monthly billing statement to be sent to me monthly, they again falsely claim that they never received payment for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/2016 ( for the record, XX/XX/XXXX has been paid too ) which are all false and fraudulent.

The bank recently changed their log-in process so that though I knew my user id and password that was not sufficient. I was required to request a verification code that was to be sent to my email address on file. I tried this 3 different times but never received the verification code. At that point I called customer service to gain access to my account ( a federally insured savings account ). After 5 minutes on hold my call was answered and I was told that this was a two week old process and that it was having technically issues and that they were unsure when it would be resolved. Apparently the verification code emails were being processed by many email servers a spam and taking hours to be delivered even though the code is only good for 10 minutes. This basically amounted to denying me access to my account, they had no provision for texting a verification code to my mobile phone. The only option was to provide them a different email through a different email provider such as gmail, yahoo, etc. 
otherwise I had no access to my accounts or funds until they fix this problem.

They said if I charged {$100000.00} on the card, I would receive XXXX points and the XXXX points could then be redeemed for {$2000.00} in airline tickets for example. 

I was concerned that something could happen with the points and asked the man on the phone if there was any way that I could ever lose these points and he reassured me that I would 'never ever lose the points ' as long as I kept my card in good standing on my end. 

I had over XXXX points and was planning on redeeming them for $ XXXX towards an airline ticket as they reassured me I could do with my points at anytime, as long as I kept my card in good standing. 

To my surprise, this XXXX, Capital One canceled my card, for no reason at all and absolutely nothing I did on my end and defrauded me for over {$1300.00} by only giving me half the value of my points. 

I had enough points that they absolutely promised on the phone and reassured me that I would never lose to deduct a {$2700.00} plane ticket I was planning to purchase and they left me with {$1300.00}, defrauding me out of {$1300.00} in earned points. 

After this happened, I then called up the new client department and once again asked : "" If I become a Capital One card holder, is there anything that will cause my points to be devalued or will I lose the full value of my points for any reason? '' I was reassured once again on the phone, as long as I kept my account in good standing that I would never lose my points and they would retain the full value as promised. 

Capital One is defrauding high point clients by waiting until they rack up hundreds of thousands of points and then canceling the accounts without notice, thus defrauding their cardholders out of thousands of dollars in earned bonuses promised to them. 

This is a serious fraudulent activity that may be impacting millions of card holders like me that are promised rewards and then when they try and cash them in, discover their card is canceled for nothing they did wrong and they lose half the value of their rewards. 

Nothing in my legal history or anything about my history has changed since I signed up with a Capital One account. They used this as an excuse, although nothing has happened to me since I signed up with the card. 

This is a serious issue of fraud on the part of Capitol One and they are making millions of dollars by defrauding high value point clients, by canceling their cards, keeping the annual yearly membership fee of the card and keeping the thousands of dollars in point value promised to clients. 

They promised me and gave me their word I would never lose the value of my points as long as I kept my card in good standing and they lied. I was promised I could cash in my points for $ XXXX and they then canceled my account and paid out half of this amount. 

I want them to stick to their word and allow me to utilize the full value of my rewards and not simply think it is acceptable to cancel my card for nothing I did wrong on my end and give me half the amount of my reward, causing me to be defrauded out of thousands of dollars in lost rewards I was promised, I would never lose as long as I kept my account in good standing, as to which I did. 

They promised me I would never lose the value of my points if I kept my account in good standing and they are STILL telling this fraudulent claim to new clients in order to get them to sign up with them..

I then got into a major car accident on XX/XX/2016 which resulted in a total loss. This was the worst scenario that could have happened. My complaint branches from the lack of knowledge incorrect information repeatedly given to me by the agents in the total loss department of the Capital One Auto Finance Department. I was sent the paperwork for a power of attorney prior to my accident, and then right after the accident I called Capital One to see if they still needed this information due to the fact the car was now in a total loss status and there would no longer be a loan for that particular car. The agent I spoke with went to call over to a department and inform them of the total loss and returned to the call and stated not to worry about it they would not need any of the loan paperwork now that the car was totaled. I later was on a 3 way call with XXXX and the total loss agent who stated they were finalizing the title and that they had received my power of attorney paperwork on a previous date. I informed the XXXX agent this was incorrect and that I had not sent this information because I was told that it was unnecessary. The XXXX agent clicked back over to the Capital One agent who stated I could fax over the power of attorney and that "" it would not hurt to receive this information twice '' ( and they provided the XXXX agent a fax number ). I faxed over the paperwork right at that time ( XXXX XXXX ). I called Capital One a few days later and found out that there was a delay on the finalization of my title ( which was needed by XXXX to issue payment ) due to the fact they had not received my Power of attorney. I stated I had faxed the document, and was informed that they can not take a legal document faxed and that they do not know why I was given this misinformed information. I immediately sent the information in the mail, but by the time they received this it had been almost a month which is delaying the process further. XXXX would not be paying the car off in full, so there would be a remaining balance. I spoke to XXXX different agents at Capital One, who stated that I would still be responsible for payment of the remaining balance, which is reasonable. The first agent stated that I would have to pay my same loan monthly amount that I currently pay until the loan was paid in full, and the second agent stated that Capital One makes payment plans and would work with me to resolve the balance, and that I would not have to pay the full amount of a monthly payment as if I had a loan the payment amount would be less. I was fine with this. What brought me to this report was today XX/XX/2016 I spoke with an agent that told me the exact opposite. He stated I would be responsible for the remaining balance in FULL once XXXX issued them their payment. That there is no option for payment plans and that I was told incorrect information. At this point I am completely furious with the agents and their lack of knowledge. Because of them I have had a delay of almost a month for the title and then the title is still not finalized, therefore XXXX still has not issued them payment and I have made XXXX monthly payment as of tomorrow for a car that is no longer in my posession.

I have their online website for total loss that states if you have a total loss with a remaining balance call the number and discuss payment options.

The vibe I am getting with corporate is as if they are n't understanding the issue, skim reading my emails, then ultimately XXXX on me by continually requesting that I call XXXX support, thus re-starting the whole process with useless tech support, and thus corporate does not understand why I 'm trying to escalate to them in the first place. 

2 ) They 've overhauled the mobile website. An initial problem I have is I am unable to log into the new mobile website from the very browsers it was writted for - a XXXX galaxy tab XXXX When I press the green button, the page simply refreshes with the XXXX XXXX cleared and no error is given. They XXXX tls XXXX on the desktop website. All in all, this is the sort of thing I am tired of - websites suddenly overhauling, and even if it works on my browsers, having fo re-learn the website again, having to wade through the ever increasing heavily active scripted eye candy and silly animations, with settings changes and payments now on pop ups on the mobile site now. XXXX : XXXX available a simpler website version that does n't abruptly change or change often, simple scripting that works on older browsers and is not an eye candy laden eyesore and slow. The aim here is to make routine actions day in and day out such as looking at my transaction history and make payments much simplier and faster without getting frustrated with the eye candy and everytime the website is overhauled. - whether the new site works on my browser or not. As an additional suggestion - make another payment only website that accepts some basic information to find your account. That is, so I do n't have to wade through eye candy and remember passwords to make payments. To summarize : stop abruptly changing the website with ever increasing heavy active scripting and eye candy, and other major changes such as disabling tls XXXX without at the very least notifying me first. XXXX simpler scripted and less eyesore websites available seconday at least. XXXX has not ack'ed this either, they just want to send me to te h support again. XXXX is in the dillusion that just because they can see it work the lstest and greatest version of XXXX, they see no issue. The real issue here is I am not going to have to buy a new computer jusy to be able upgrade my browser, just to look at the same old transaction history and make payments. It 's a pain because I have to go to a particular computer and browser combo to access XXXX. They whole thing is built to spurr consumerism - I have to buy a new computer every 5 years just to look at the same old transaction history and make payment, let alone relearn the whole website again and deal with the silly eye candy. *If paper could be made to not be viewable with certain eyes, corporate would do that to sell more eyes at the hospital. 

3 ) I have been unable to log in via phone XXXX. It just send me to a rep, and not the menu.",Capital One,MA,0.00607821283194
146648,146648,146648,Credit card,Other,Today I received a prescreened offer from Capital One for a credit card. ( Reservation # XXXX Access Code XXXX ). This offer was very confusing to me as I am 1 ) XXXX ) 2 ) low income 3 ) have a low credit score and am not eligible for credit cards. I contacted the opt out phone number given by Capital and could not complete the process because the automated system inappropriately asked for my social security number and date of birth. This complaint is to have you stop Capital or any other bank from making offers to people who are clearly not eligible and to stop the credit card opt out company from asking for inappropriate information.,Capital One,CA,-0.0868518518519

Capital One initially credit me back and said they would investigate. One XX/XX/2016 Capital One re-billed me the charge they initially credited. XX/XX/2016 I started receiving harassing calls to pay a for all the finance charges and late fees that they tacked on because of re-bill. I contacted Capital One and I was told that they did not investigate the dispute that was originally filed. I was told they would credit my account back for the late fees. finance charges, and accrued since the initial disputed that had been filed in XX/XX/XXXX. The there was a total of {$170.00} that was suppose to be credited back to my account because of their error and failure to dispute. In return, Capital One closed my credit card, falsely reported inaccurate information to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX in regards to my account being past due, charged off and delinquent. They violated my consumer rights under the FCRA. They also took my {$200.00} deposit that was used to secure the card since it was a secured credit card. They refuse to return it or either credit the deposit towards another card. They have failed to provide adequate resolution that has been detrimental to my credit and have defamed my person as to report false information to the credit bureaus. They have called and repeatedly threatened illegal legal action against me. I am wanting adequate response and resolution as this has been an issue since XX/XX/2016 that has not been resolved.",Capital One,TX,-0.0630434782609
